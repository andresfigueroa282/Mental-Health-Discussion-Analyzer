# Mental-Health-Discussion-Analyzer
The purpose of this project is to build a tool that collects, processes, and visualizes online discussions about mental health (like posts on Reddit).

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project aims to:
- **Understand sentiment trends** in mental health conversations.
- **Identify** common topics and keywords (e.g., "anxiety", "therapy", "depression").
- **Quantify** coping strategies (e.g., exercise, journaling, therapy, medication).
- **Visualize** patterns and trends to better understand online mental health discussions.

**Note:** I hope to learn how to scrape data from different websites, use tools like `tableau`, and familiarize myself with NLP models

## 🛠️ Workflow
1. **Scraping**  
   - Collecting posts and comments from Reddit.  
   - Extracting relevant metadata (titles, body texts, timestamps, etc.).  

2. **NLP Processing**  
   - Clean and preprocess text.  
   - Perform keyword extraction.  
   - Apply sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, negative).  

3. **Visualization in Tableau**  
   - Build dashboards showing:  
     - Sentiment trends over time  
     - Top keywords and topics  
     - Coping strategies mentioned

- Are online conversations about mental health becoming more positive or negative over time?  
- What mental health challenges are most frequently discussed?  
- Which coping strategies are viewed positively in the community?

## 📌 Future Extensions
- Expand beyond Reddit to forums, blogs, or Twitter.  
- Apply **topic modeling** (LDA) to cluster discussions.  
- Create an **automated pipeline** for real-time monitoring.  
- Explore predictive analytics (e.g., forecasting discussion spikes).
