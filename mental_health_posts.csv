I feel behind in life and it is making me depressed.,1,0,2025-09-08 23:29:39,"I just feel so behind in life. I keep wishing I could stop comparing myself to other people, but it’s hard not to. I graduated high school in 2022 and started community college in March 2023. I just graduated this past summer, and now I’ve only been at my university for about two weeks.

Because I took the community college route, I feel like I’m “behind.” Most likely I won’t graduate until I’m 23 or 24, and with my major I’ll probably need a master’s degree to even be successful. On top of that, I’ve never had a real job. The only one I ever had I quit after two weeks. I don’t have much, I don’t own anything, and I drive my mom’s car to campus every day.

Meanwhile, the people in my classes seem so far ahead of me. They’ve had jobs, internships, joined clubs, built résumés, and gotten experience. I have nothing like that. It makes me feel like I’m failing before I even started. Everyone keeps telling me I’m being too hard on myself, but I can’t tell if they’re just saying that to make me feel better.

I’m 21, and I can’t stop wondering: does it seem like I’m actually behind in life? Has anyone older than me been in this position and come out okay? Any advice or perspective would mean a lot right now."
I don't understand why I'm hurting,1,0,2025-09-08 23:27:41,"I've been diagnosed by a psychiatrist for depression and being on the spectrum. Overall, I live a privileged, easy life where I don't have to worry about anything.

Sure, there have been a few traumatic events (my mum almost dying twice, me getting raped), but I was already depressed before that and I got over these events.

I've been to therapy multiple times, though that was before my asd diagnosis. Not sure if that makes a difference. 

I've tried so hard to put myself back together for years. But I always feel so broken. Like something isn't there. I don't understand why I'm hurting even though I'm living a good life"
Struggling with Maladaptive Daydreaming: How Do I Break the Cycle and Regain Focus,1,0,2025-09-08 23:27:27,"Hi everyone,
I’m reaching out because I’m struggling with a habit that’s been affecting my mental clarity and overall well-being, and I’m determined to change. For the past few years, I’ve developed an intense pattern of behavior that I believe is maladaptive daydreaming. I frequently immerse myself in vivid fantasies where I envision myself as a confident, successful, “alpha” version of myself. These daydreams are often triggered by watching motivational or cinematic video edits (e.g., YouTube montages or social media clips) that amplify this idealized self-image. To heighten the experience, I’ll play music and physically move around my room, pacing or jumping, which gives me a significant dopamine rush.
While this feels exhilarating in the moment, it’s become a problematic cycle. I spend hours lost in these fantasies, which leaves me feeling unmotivated, mentally foggy, and disconnected from reality. I’ve noticed a decline in my focus, productivity, and even my sense of mental sharpness over time, which makes me feel like I’ve lost some of my cognitive edge. I’m fed up with this pattern and want to take control of my life again, but I’m unsure how to break free from this addictive habit."
I hate my life,2,2,2025-09-08 23:26:05,"I'm 30m. And I hate my life. I hate my job and the house I rent. I hate that I live with my mom, even if it's only because she doesn't want to live alone since my dad died. My sisters are all married with families but I'm afraid I'll die alone. I have no friends. I feel so stuck and alone. I need therapy bit don't have insurance and can't afford it. I don't feel anyone actually cares about me, or who I am. Everyone in my family thinks less of gay people, so I never felt comfortable coming out, even if they already know/suspect. So I hide who I am inside. I used to want to leave town and start again but couldn't imagine just leaving my mom alone tho. At this point tho i have given up hope. And the honest truth is, if it wouldn't make my mom sad, I would have already ended my own life. I don't feel I have any thing in my life to live for besides not wanting tobreak my mom's heart."
Guys it's slowly but surely becoming unbearable,1,1,2025-09-08 23:22:24,"I can't. I just can't. 

At day, at work, with friends.. i am all happy.

But at night... My insides are BURNING. 

I am not exaggerating. You need to see my pillow is soaked from tears each night. For 3 months straight and NOTHING helps. NOTHING. 

I am still a SAD FUCKING PSYCHO that only wants to do good, to become better. 

I can't I just can't. That fucking breakup, it feels like I lost all my heart. My happy me will never be the same. 

I lack sleep, i do exercise and again, at day I am active and social. 

But at night I become this sad person. Crying endlessly over good old memories.

I am sorry for myself I have to go through this, maybe some day I will find peace. But now it seems so impossible"
What's a *subtle* habit you developed and realized it was due to your mental health/coping mechanisms? How'd you respond to that?,1,0,2025-09-08 23:21:55,"As I'm finally starting to heal from childhood traumas, I'm noticing some subtle habits that I didn't realize were a result of my mental health. I think it would be helpful to hear other similar experiences and how you realized/overcame it!

For example, I realized my quietness/social anxiety (something I've struggled with for 20+ years) was largely because I felt like everything I said had to be meaningful and bring value to the conversation. I'd have a lot of opinions and thoughts, and even funny jokes, that I never shared because I'd analyze if it mattered or not. It got worse as I experienced more trauma in my adulthood and this habit slowly stripped away my personality. I knew my personality was still there, but everyone perceived me as quiet. All it took was getting a sales job where people are describing me as ""soft spoken"" to realize I needed to change something because it's not really true. I learned that people first connect by making ""meaningless"" conversations, and from there you lead into more interesting discussions. No wonder I had so much trouble truly connecting with people! It sounds so obvious but I think it's so important to talk about because of how ""small talk"" is commonly described as surface level and meaningless. 

I overcame this by preparing 3-4 questions I could ask the person before seeing them, especially if I didn't really know them well yet. It made me unbelievably anxious, as I felt like I wouldn't know what to respond back. And honestly, there were many times I didn't know what to say and I probably sounded really awkward. But eventually with practice, I've gotten a lot better!

Ok, your turn!"
"Why do I feel empty when I have no real reason to? (Idk if the NSFW tag is necessary or not, mainly a vent post but answers are welcome)",1,1,2025-09-08 23:21:20,"Hey
So I've never posted on reddit before so I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing here. I don't know if this is even the right place to talk about this, anything really, so please let me know
I really don't know how to word my question, honestly I feel stupid even talking about this but I feel like I need to hear something about it. (Apologies for the incoming rambling)

I don't understand why I feel so depressed at times. Genuinely don't. I mean, I don't take the best care of myself, I'll admit that upfront. Mostly physically but mentally too sometimes. But I just- Genuinely don't know.
I've struggled with anxiety for a long time, and have a few mental health issues. But I've never understood why. I'm not meaning to brag, truly, I'm being honest. I have a life most would feel lucky to have I would think. I have a genuinely loving and supportive family. I've never been abused, people treat me with kindness, I've even barely been bullied (which I'm surprised about sometimes given I have and had many traits you typically see for people getting bullied. Overweight, acting odd, sometimes socially awkward, anxious, etc). My friends are all amazing, I've never wanted for the necessities growing up, the only thing I can think of that's really shitty in my life is- just the world as a whole. And I know all this. I know I'm privileged with what I've been supplied with in my life, and I'm grateful for it.

So why do I hate myself so much? For being the one to have all this, for being who I am, looking how I do, everything. I feel like such a faker, an ungrateful bitch who just wants attention. And that just makes all of the feelings even worse. I feel worthless, like nothing I can do will ever be worth it. When my friends struggle I'm always there to support them, telling them to keep going. So why do I wish I could just... stop? That I could fade away and give all these advantages I've been given to someone who deserves them? To someone who'd actually do good in the world instead of just- being some mediocre artist or whatever I end up doing. 
I don't even feel... sad thinking about this. I just don't feel... anything? I think? I just genuinely wish I could fade away and let life continue for the people I care about as if I never existed. 
Usually I end up over-eat when I start thinking like this, sometimes I get really scratchy. Even that makes me feel like a poser, like I'm not *really* doing sh, so I'm clearly not really depressed (which isn't a healthy perspective on myself, but is any of this really?). I've never attempted, but I've thought about it. Never enough to feel like I want to go through with it. 
There's really no true trigger for this line of thinking, it will just happen. Usually when I'm left alone with myself without making myself do something to distract myself. But yeah... I don't really know what I want from this. I'd say I want help, maybe I do? I'm genuinely not sure. Maybe putting this out there instead of keeping it all inside will make something different happen. I don't know. I understand if this needs to be taken down, I probably will after a while anyways.
If it means anything, I feel a little proud? I hate bothering or upsetting people, so no one irl really knows the full extent of how I feel. But writing this feels like I actually tried to do something for once. Not sure how long it'll last, but it's nice.
Thanks for bearing with all this, if anyone bothered to read the whole thing."
"Need help for a number of diagnosis (OCD, IBD).",1,1,2025-09-08 23:09:12,"I’ll start by stating my age 24, trauma and list of diagnosis: OCD, Anxiety, Panic Disorder, Insomnia, and (gut related) Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Ulcerative Collitis, Severe Acid Reflux, Gastric Polyps, Hiatal Hernia . I suffered SA when i was 13-16 by a religious figure and also blackmail, religious abuse, physical and mental abuse from his ‘cult’. I will spare the details but at the age if 16 I started having panic attacks, at 20 I got extreme diarrhea and diagnosed with IBS, and last year at 23 I got all of the other diagnosis by several doctors. My IBD currently affects my quality of life and I cant help but wonder if it’s related to my past trauma. I live in a small island and I dont know of any doctors who can treat brain/gut related disorders. I have been in therapy since 20 years old, taking medication for anxiety for 1 year. I think somehow my brain could rewire itself to repair the damages from my trauma and somehow fix my gut. Has anyone gone through the same thing or a similar experience. Pls advise me something to do because I am lost and my IBD prevents me from living a normal life."
self-image: how do you see yourself?,1,1,2025-09-08 23:06:20,"when i think of myself there's not much i envision and i feel like i may have purposely prevented building a sense of self.  i don't like to feel for myself and i think of it as sort of self-indulgent.  i do think about myself.  a lot.  but mostly as a situation, not really as a person.  i'm not sure i like that.  i don't know if that's healthy.

for anyone reading, how do you see yourself?  how do you access your self-image?  do you have visual representations of yourself in your mind?  do you imagine yourself in your own life or do you associate with a different situation?  is the focus on you yourself or does it involve your relationships?  is it defined by social status or a job title or your gender?  very curious to know."
Bad things are going to happen and I fear it'll make me spiral,1,0,2025-09-08 22:56:13,"I've had violent thought just about all my life and I'm extremely depressed and mentally ill, the last things keeping me from spiralling are gonna dissapear in less than a year time and I fear I won't be in a thinking state. There's a chance that I'll go in a psychosis again and that could probably mean that people will end up hurt or worse. Im planning on discussing this with my psychologist as I don't want to ruin lives anymore. But in the meantime I thought I might as well make a post about it so I could calm down and get advice from you guys. 

This is not for upvotes, I don't care about stupid internet points"
I feel so lonely,1,1,2025-09-08 22:44:44,A lot has happened and i don't realy wanna get into it cause it hurt so much. My gf used to listen to me but she told me it was to draining for her and im on the brink of losing her. I just want to talk to someone its been so long since ive talked to anyone
my bf (24M) is struggling with mental health issues and i (23F) am wondering how to navigate this,1,0,2025-09-08 22:43:29,"recently ive (23F) been noticing that my bf (24M) has been distancing himself from me.How often we see each other has been a point of contention in our nearly three year relationship but recently even texting has become more sparse.We were meant to go on a date last weekend so I could show him my new favourite korean restaurant however he texted me cancelling and asking if we dont see each other for a while as seeing me made his mental health spiral.I asked for an explanation and he said that it was more so he felt that he’d become mean sometimes or very disinterested which ended in us arguing (this has been happening on calls) and then his mental health would spiral as he would feel very guilty after.I agreed to the space and he agreed to start seeing a therapist from next week as he’s been doing very badly mentally for the past few months as he grappled with establishing a new career and feeling like a failure.

However now Im wondering if i made the right decision.My sister is best friends with his best friends sister and she told me a few weeks back that his best friend has been complaining that my bf never hangs out with him anymore.I asked my bf why he’s not been hanging with his friends anymore and he told me that he wasn’t in the mood to be doing so and that all he needed was me.I didn’t think this was healthy and even though we were only seeing each other once a week at that point , I offered to do fortnightly if he felt that it was overwhelming to see me and them every week.He said he’d rather see me in response.Anyways fast forward to now , I’m extra worried that I can’t see him often now because he’s been implying that he sees no future and previously in the past before we were dating he did attempt to end his life.However anytime we’ve spoken about it he’s assured me that he is now afraid of dying.I’m also worried that my worries are biased and im making up excuses for them because ive always been the one to push for us to see each other often.

But I’ve made it clear , Im available to talk or if he needs anything but is that enough?

Im just at a loss on what to do.I feel very frustrated but Im scared to say this because it would make him feel bad and i dont want to make it about me.

tldr my bf is struggling with mental health issues and i am wondering how to navigate this"
I don’t know what’s exactly wrong with me.,1,0,2025-09-08 22:41:58,"Hey. Probably one of a lot of my posts there which I’ll do later.

So, uh, how can I make my thought more strict, structured? It feels like broken glass is shattered all around. I feel there is some problems, but I can’t name them one by one. Two things that I can actually name - bipolar affective disorder (2d type, without maniacal phases) and gender dysphoria. 22yo, if needs.

I feel… Surrounded? Hope you get the point of view.

Any advice, please. Mwah you all."
How do I start looking after myself?,1,2,2025-09-08 22:34:31,"I've been weathering a particularly bad depression storm for several months, one that I haven't really experienced for many years (thankfully).

I'm trying my best to get through it - seeing my psychologist when I can. But it's the small everyday things that I feel last time helped me the most. Getting outside, putting moisturiser on my skin to help me feel good, brushing my hair so I can feel a bit more put together. Hopefully eventually going back to the gym and making a routine.

For context I thrive off routine - I have autism somewhat, so it really helps me. But I've lost all my routines.

The house is a bit of a mess because I just don't have the energy to really clear it all right now along with work. My partner (adhd) also experiences depression periods every so often. We try and support each other as best we can, but lately often I feel like a terrible partner - my anxious brain causes me to overthink everything I do which then turns to being annoying for my partner. I get it though - I wouldn't want someone bugging me with simple questions every 5 seconds. And they are simple things, really. Again I just overthink literally everything because of my brain state atm.

Anyway, I'm looking for tips on how can I start to actually give a shit about myself? In a way that will help me gain confidence. My confidence and self esteem is so low, and I often think of just ending my life because sometimes the pain of existing is too much. But I've lately tried to remind myself that if I won't look after myself for ME, then maybe I can do it instead for those around me (family, friends etc).

I was doing so well a few years back. But not having any routines and going through a ton of life changes has mucked me all up.

I'm trying my best today to not let the darkness consume me. If it does, that's alright. But for now I'm here and I want to help myself get better. Any advice of any sort is very welcome. Thanks for reading"
Really Depressed and I've Lost All Motivation and Joy,2,1,2025-09-08 22:33:25,"Hi so I'm 12 weeks pregnant, and I've gotten extremely depressed the last few weeks. My life kind of just is the same thing everyday (except for when I have work.) I don't feel excitement or joy in anything. Most days I doom scroll and lay in bed. I used to paint and make youtube videos. But I don't enjoy doing anything creative anymore. I just keep thinking to myself ""my art sucks, my videos suck, no one cares."" I've tried telling myself that I should just enjoy a hobby with no intention of making money off of it or commodifying it in some way. But I can't shake the need to be really good at art or do none at all. I locked my phone earlier so I could finally get out of bed and do some art, but instead I just cried in my garage (where I paint) because I only felt the overwhelming pressure that my art needed to be good. I'm sad that when I was a teenager I was practically printing art and youtube videos, but now as an adult I'm only jaded and obsessed with how successful my work is. 

I'm honestly tired of being in the house all the time. But I also just have no idea what to do with my time. I recently finished school, so school just left behind a massive surplus of time that I'm not used to having. 

It's not even just art, it feels like all my hobbies are suffering. I used to do tarot everyday, now I hardly touch my decks. I can't focus on books at all, though that has been a longer running issue. Video games don't really bring me joy like they used to. 

Everything feels exhausting and overwhelming. So I just kind of freeze and do nothing. I've had this happen before but not in such a long stretch as this. 

I feel like such a failure. I don't know where to go from here. Because I looked up ""things to do"" and just got overwhelmed by how many things I could do. I have considered volunteer work, particularly with animal shelters. Because I've recently gotten into animal photography and want to help get good photos of adoptable pets. But I worry I can't handle other responsibilities, like dealing with litter boxes, (because you're not really supposed to be around them when you're pregnant) or even just long term committing the time that they need. (The one animal shelter I've contacted so far said they wanted at least 6 months of volunteer commitment, but I'm due in March and worry I won't be able to volunteer at all after I give birth or even just the last month of my pregnancy.) 

I just don't know what to do to stop being so lazy and uninspired all the time. 

Have any of you gone through this? How did you get out of it?"
I always have memory issues when I’m depressed. Do you?,1,0,2025-09-08 22:26:28,"On top of it I have OCD and a rare condition called aphantasia, the inability to visualize. I got it later in life from a bad depression when I used to be able to visualize in extreme detail. I still can visualize but it is soo faint and if I’m healthy my memory is actually quite good despite the lack of visuals. 

But recently I had a traumatic event happen at work, I’ve moved across the country for this job and they laid me off. It sent my body into shock and completely mentally disassociated me. 

That’s when the memory issues began and with having partial aphantasia it really dampens the strength of my memories. Even forgetting what I did a second ago or what I just read/wrote etc. 

When this happens my clinical OCD kicks in and wants to focus harder and harder on trying to remember but the more I force it the harder it is to retrieve them. 

What I’ve noticed is that if I stop forcing, relax and let the memories come to me then things begin to get a bit better. It’s very frustrating because I was living life normal, having come a long way from recovering from something like this years ago and I’m here again. 

I know it will pass but it’s very frightening when it happens as it’s hard to access I am and my sense of self during these moments. 

Has anything similar happen to you? (beside the aphantasia as I know that’s rare)

Does anyone else struggle with memory when depressed or in shock?"
I just hate myself,2,1,2025-09-08 22:24:57,"I just don’t care about myself much at all i eat when im sad, i slowly drift from friends, i can’t even feel emotions right , im just a disappointment to people near me, im just pathetic do people care or is it just pity i just want to restart maybe have a actual childhood instead of suicidal and crippled for years one but here i am in 20s and not done much with my life"
University life as an anxious person,1,1,2025-09-08 22:21:57,"This is a lot to say but I just feel SO emotionally exhausted and overwhelmed with the build up to going to university for the first time ever. I’m a little ashamed to admit it but I’ve grown up very sheltered, and being out of my comfort zone gives me anxiety and paranoia.

Speaking of which, I can’t deal with unpredictable/unplanned scenarios and this exact situation has played out; there’s no space left to live on my university campus. I feel numb right now. I’m second guessing all of my decisions I’ve made with going to uni, I don’t want to feel uncomfortable and scared, being out of my comfort zone every day.

I can’t bear it. I just feel like these past couple of months my luck has been genuinely horrible. Every time I think about what my life will be like in university, now that I’m off campus I tear up every time, when only a few months ago I was dreaming and planning out my day to day life (assuming I was going to stay on campus). Just why me? Of all people I was the one with horrible luck, I’m an anxious mess and I get homesick even just a few days without my parents :("
Can’t stay awake thanks to depression,1,1,2025-09-08 22:21:40,"I use all of my energy at school I am very introverted and I have really bad anxiety at school and it takes so much out of me. So when I go home I love it but then all I can do is sleep because I am so tired from being around so many people I literally can’t keep my eyes open and I can’t stop sleeping. No I am no getting therapy nor medication for either of my conditions but that’s a long story. I am 15 and I am male. Please help, I can’t even enjoy the best part of my day."
I dont feel like a 'normal' person ??!,1,1,2025-09-08 22:12:41,"This is about to be a really badly explained and worded question, I don't exactly know what the question is yet so bare with. 

I feel like I'm not a proper person in the way everyone else is, everyone else seems very Real. I feel like I'm just a little bit Wrong, like my brain isn't right. This might not make any sense but I can only think to explain it this way, it's almost like there's glass or something similar Surrounding my brain, everything is just a little bit far away I guess? It's like I'm too far inside my head. Every now and then I'll feel normal, which is what the question is about, but I'll get to that, and when I feel 'normal' it's like I Know what to do and what to say (like it seems everyone else does) and it feels like my brain is empty, in a nice way, feels quicker. 
 
I usually feel so Out of it, and everything I do is just because I Have to, I have no real motivation for anything. But when I feel less like that, it's actually nice to do regular person things, you know like talking to people and eating and brushing your teeth. Like wow! It's so nice to be a person. 

I've never really noticed any real Reason for why it happens when I feel normal, i don't know if that's just cause it very rarely happens, or if there just is no reason and it js happens when it happens or what. 

The last time it happened wasn't That long ago, a week or so maybe. 
I'd been watching this YouTube video, it was a podcast which is irrelevant but whatever, and one of the guys was talking about whatever, and it was almost like by listening to him explain what he was doing and stuff, my brain was like ohhh yeah that's right, that's how you're meant to be. I can imagine that's Not what it is though. 

I'm just Wondering if Anyone knows how to feel like a normal person ALL of the time. 
It's pretty awful, I basically Do nothing because I feel no real need to do anything."
Weed rant.,2,0,2025-09-08 22:06:48,"When I’m high off weed I feel like I have a good time for half the time but the other half I get in my head and keep asking my self if this is really what being high feels like, I can’t really tell if it’s dpdr but it’s definitely not a good feeling. It feels like I’m living in a dream. I always describe how I feel to my friends and they just tell me that I’m tripping and it’s all in my head. Which some of it is but even when I try to distract my self I still have that lingering thought of “this ain’t what being high is supposed to feel like “. Also my emotions are really strong and my thoughts have way more meaning than they did when I was sober. I guess my thoughts and emotions throughout the day are just mostly negative and I only realize when I feel the emotions intensely when I’m high. I kinda feel lonely when I’m high around friends because I feel like they don’t feel the high I feel and they are all characters from a memory. I also hate the fact that when I’m sober I want to get high and want to disassociate to cope with the sht I’m going though, but when I am, I want to be sober. I don’t like ether but I want the other when I’m in the state."
I don't have depression but i feel like life isn't worth it.,3,1,2025-09-08 22:04:39,"I don't have any concrete plans, I think that's probably a great thing. But I feel like the world is just so unfair, so cruel, and i know people say that all the time, but i notice it in EVERYTHING. Misogyny for example, for me it isn't just annoying, it fills me with hatred to the point it feels like i'll catch on fire. Or ignorance. Or the way society conditioned us to think about normal human stuff as something taboo or shameful (like sexuality, for women especially... misogyny always pisses me off, of course because i'm a girl. in some people's logics, apparently women can only be either an innocent angel or a whore). Or the way social media nowadays is all about spreading unnecessary hatred. Everything pisses me off.
It gives me the feeling that i just wanna get rid of all the bad stuff in the world. Eliminate EVERYONE that spreads anything harmful. But there are more than 8 billion people here, I have absolutely NO control over anything, and even friends seem to not fully think the same way as me, they don't care as much either. So it feels like since i can't change anything, the only way out would be ending my own life instead.
I feel as if my suicidal thoughts couldn't be really considered suicidal thoughts, they happen only vaguely when I'm crying really hard for a specific reason, or in these moments of disillusionment with humanity. I'm not depressed, i don't think i have most of the signs for clinical depression at all, but i do feel a deep disappointment at the world and humanity, the TINIEST things to the bigger problems. It makes me feel like though my daily life is fun when i'm distracting myself, life still isn't worth it after all. What makes seeing all these humans being stupid, hateful and violent, worth it? Nothing good ever compares to the disappointment i feel with the world. Humans could have been beautiful inside and out. Sometimes they are. but 90% of the time they're these monsters, and it makes me feel like life isn't worth it.
I'm sorry. I feel like i'm rambling. I don't tend to express myself that well, so I apologize. I just typed out what was in my mind."
I don’t understand,1,1,2025-09-08 21:58:24,"I can’t remember how long it’s been since I haven’t felt worthless, like I’m doing something wrong or am wrong. Like I’m not good at anything and never will be. I’m not good enough and I never will be, no matter what I do and no matter how hard I try. Even at my job I feel like the idiot. Why can’t I stop feeling like this? I don’t understand."
Were you always told that your parents were nice?,1,3,2025-09-08 21:56:50,"We all love when our parents get told that they're pretty or nice. What we don't love is when we're told all of those things but are parents act completely different behind closed doors. I'm 16. I have an older sister who is 21 and I always saw her as more of a parent then my parents ever were. Growing up, I often was told to suck it up when I was feeling down. Or, when I was crying and told my parents about why I was crying, they would shrug it off as nothing. This lead me to build up childhood trauma and to keep my emotions to myself in fear that whoever I will tell about it to will judge me. My mom played a main factor in this but so did my dad. I'm sick of being in this house hold and I want to move away from my state to get away from my family. Whenever I discuss this with my mom she talks about how it's most likely not going to happen and instead of trying to help me, brings me down. I can not stress it enough when I say that I genuinely hate my mom and dad. Everybody looks at me crazy when I say this but they would understand me if they knew what I went through. Am I the bad guy?"
Feeling like I'm living in a dream since starting medication – experiences with derealization,1,0,2025-09-08 21:49:08,"Hi everyone,  
I want to share my experience with derealization and depersonalization and see if anyone else has gone through something similar.

**How I was before:**  
I've always had anxiety and hypervigilance. I would startle at sounds, always be on alert, and feel “vibes” – for example, thinking about a friend or hearing a song would give me a specific vibe associated with a color, smell, or image. Days of the week had colors – Monday felt black, music like Korn felt dark, familiar smells brought nostalgia. I could clearly feel God’s presence, I was fascinated by things, I could cry, feel fear, chills. Seeing signs like “222” or “333” would make me feel excited and hopeful.

**What changed:**  
I started Buspirone 20 mg for anxiety. Later, Wellbutrin was added, which helped me a lot: more energy, increased libido, motivation. But I started noticing changes: sometimes I felt numb, other times euphoric or impulsive, my emotions were unstable, and I stopped feeling the vibes and connections with people.

When Concerta was added, everything changed drastically: it calmed me completely, but in a terrible way – I felt like a zombie, no thoughts, no motivation, my personality felt completely altered, I didn’t feel joy, I was in a “dream state” nonstop. After stopping Concerta cold turkey, derealization worsened – constant dreamlike state, no emotions, no memory, distorted sense of time.

**How I am now:**  
It’s been almost a month and a half since I stopped Concerta. I sleep, eat, and function better. I’m on Sertraline 50 mg for 19 days and 15 mg mirtazapine, emotions are more stable, but there’s still a huge mental fog. People no longer have the vibes they used to, connections feel weak, the world feels dreamlike. Occasionally, brief nostalgia or emotions return, but disappear immediately.

**Question:**  
What have you done to fully get out of this derealization/depersonalization state? Are there ways to feel connected to the world and my emotions again?"
How do you eat?,1,3,2025-09-08 21:47:37,"Throwaway because I'm embarrassed.

I hate eating. Not all the time, but often enough that I consider it a victory to have two meals in one day. I know that's bad, but it's the truth and it's reaching a point where I'm struggling to eat anything at all, especially now that I'm living by myself and have no one to preform for.

I have no issues with my appearance, I think it's the act of chewing that really does it for me. There's just something about it that weirds me out, but even though I've tried protein drinks (suggested by my therapist) it doesn't help because of the grainy texture. Broth, milk and smoothies are fine, but not enough to sustain a grown adult. I love to cook, but it's like as soon as I get it on my plate it immediately loses it's appeal. And it's really irritating to stop what I'm doing to partake in an activity that makes me feel like crap three times a day, if I remember to do it at all. It's like the thing in my head that's supposed to tell me that I'm hungry is broken or something.

I know that I'm probably going to get a lot of ""go to therapy"" comments on this, but I already am. I want to get better, I just don't know where to get the motivation to do so. Forcing myself to eat has only backfired; how do you figure out how to do something you don't like multiple times a day for the rest of your life?

Thanks in advance."
Postpartum Mental Health... Guilt and Isolation Are Killing Me,0,4,2025-09-08 21:40:46,"After giving birth, l've been feeling constant guilt and isolation, even though I'm surrounded by family.
These feelings affect my daily life and my ability to fully enjoy my baby.
Any advice on how to find some inner balance?"
I’m just so fucking scared all the time,1,0,2025-09-08 21:38:35,I’ve had so much bad shit happen to me I’m always scared something bad will happen again. Ive finally become a bit more stable and I have a partner but im scared that something terrible will happen. If they left me or died I couldn’t handle it I don’t think. I really love my partner and losing them would break me. I’m so scared and I feel so alone.
How to get motivation,1,2,2025-09-08 21:38:32,Do any of you have some suggestions for getting yourself to do stuff/being motivated? I feel like all I ever want to do is lay down and be on my phone even though I know that I would enjoy other things more. Everything else just seems kinda overwhelming. Especially having to plan and start it.
Currently have covid - my constant anxiety that I felt was becoming a nervous breakdown is gone?,1,0,2025-09-08 21:38:02,"So - long story short - I have ADHD, PMDD, GAD, and depression. (I’m actually fun at parties at guys) 

Lately, my life has been a mess. Both jobs have not been going well, my full time job is putting my job on the line after years of success due to perceived lack of professionalism, bills have just been piling on, I have a parent going through cancer treatment, no support, doing everything by myself - etc.

I’ve been feeling for like over a month that I am just going to lose it. Just straight up have a nervous breakdown. 

All of a sudden, after I tested positive and realized my bad cold was Covid, everything seems fine. It’s tough, but it’s fixable. I feel like I just need to recover and I’ll get everything going and it will be okay. I don’t know if this is something with brain inflammation from Covid, or simply being able to just focus on myself for a week, or what it is. My brain is the calmest it has been in months. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Maybe I finally just cracked? 😂"
So stressed out and I don't know how to cope,1,2,2025-09-08 21:30:56,"I feel that I'm always stressed for a very long time now. I remember when I was in highschool and it was summer break. I'd still have that feeling of stress that even my unobservant mom would point out.

Fast forward to fresh grad: I'm currently job hunting and balancing my relationship. I have a lot of things that stress me out emotionally and it keeps me up tossing and turning at night. I feel like I want to rip my head off because of the stress.

I don't have healthy coping mechanisms, and my bad attention span and joint pain isn't helping; writing in a journal or doing art like I used to is off the table.

What else can I do to get things off my chest at night?"
Chronic pain going untreated is the main reason for my suicidal thoughts.,1,3,2025-09-08 21:16:18,"Hi, i don’t expect anyone to read this or answer i just needed to vent somewhere cause i can’t talk about it with anyone else. I’ve had chronic migraines for 3 years and considering i’m a minor (16) there’s not much a neurologist can do to help as they can’t prescribe pain meds to minors. I understand completely why they can’t but it sucks living with chronic pain all over my head and face 24/7. It disrupts my sleep, motivation, and everyday functioning. It’s the main reason why I have so many suicidal thoughts bc i just want the pain to stop. I’ve tried various meds over the past years that do absolutely nothing and am just in a constant state of pain. I have a year and a half to go until i’m not considered a minor anymore and I don’t know if i can last with the pain this much longer."
"It will be worse when everything gets better,",1,0,2025-09-08 21:15:19,"I have so many instances like this that, is no longer ""don't you have a feeling that something bad is gonna happen when you're happy?"" No, I know for sure something bad will happen 100% ,I would say is self-sabotage but 90% of the time is things that I cannot control

This isn't part of adulthood,this is not my sex to blame ,I don't care if I'm pretty or not to others, the problem is just me as a person is like I'm a bad omen

My cats died horribly,I got robbed again, I'm gonna be alone on my house and work for 3 weeks, I'm sick again and in pain and if nothing bad happens my mind makes sure I don't forget that feeling of dread is always like that like nothing can get better than that

Apart from that people make sure I remember it, either being straight up mean and rude or making fun of me like I'm a joke for existing. Is almost laughable being over 20 and getting kids in their 12-17 being mean or making fun of your for laughs like it always have been, hard to register I'm over 20 when I get the same treatment as if I where 13 again."
Constant arguing and screaming,1,0,2025-09-08 21:14:14,"My parents are divorced, they used to argue constantly and scream at each other hours a day till I was 12, often it was directed at me too and I still remember a few times I absolutely panicked from that.

My dad got a new girlfriend a year ago or so, she cares quite a bit about me and has taught me a lot of things. But now it’s starting all over again, constant arguing and screaming, I keep repeating the words I hear screamed at me in my head, my dad terrifies me at times, but he also seems to love me, he never has time for me, but he does make it clear he loves me. I don’t know what to think about that, his actions speak otherwise and he’s pretty deranged at times. 

My mom isn’t much better either, her place is a mess, even worse than my dad’s place. She keeps throwing trash into my room which I try to keep tidy and doesn’t listen to me or take responsibility ever. She’s constantly depressed and watching Netflix whenever she has free time. 

My friends are practically my lifeline, I love spending time with them and we have very fun adventures and activities together all the time. Yet I’m afraid of losing them. For some reason I have an irrational fear of sharing anything about myself, even saying “I like languages” took a lot of courage out of me to say. I don’t understand why that is, I’ve tried explaining it to a friend of mine and they just got confused. I get incredibly scared when I get asked questions about myself in person. I know it’s really not that bad, but I’m just incredibly lonely because of all this. I want to be understood but at the same time I don’t. I just want someone to listen."
Why cant i enjoy music anymore??,1,4,2025-09-08 21:13:49,"I used to LOVE music. Listened to it everyday. Heavy metal, Rock, jazz punk, you name it. But since march of this year, music just sounds like noise. I try to reinstate music and try to enjoy it but nothing. Wth is happening to me...."
My parents are now aware that I’m not doing well.,1,0,2025-09-08 21:12:59,"So, in an earlier post, I (18m) talked about my recent struggles with my mental health. I’m not sure if I mentioned it there but I’ve been keeping this whole thing hidden from me parents by just telling them “I’m stressed” or “things are a little stressful right now”. Mainly because I don’t want to see their reaction if I tell them that I’m falling behind in school and have thought about hurting myself. But my mom just popped into my room and asked “is everything ok” and if “I was happy”. Apparently, someone at my job overheard me talking about my struggles and contacted them. She says I should look into going to an on campus therapist or counselor, but I’m afraid. What else did they tell them? Who told them? Will they treat me differently? Will they start monitoring me? I don’t where else to go with this information. So my questions are 1) am I overthinking this, and 2) should I be worried?

Edit: she came in again and. She never does and I feel like something is off."
"TW, does this count as SH?",2,3,2025-09-08 21:11:44,"today i was fidgeting with my pencil, and the end of the pencil where the eraser usually is was kinda sharp, and i was scraping it against my skin. it didn’t break skin or bleed or anything, and it didn’t really hurt. but it left some marks, and stung (only a tiny bit) a little bit after. i obviously didn’t do it with the intent of harming myself, and i didn’t even realize what i was doing until i already did it. does this count as self harm? i really hope it doesn’t because i’m less than 10 days away from a 200 day sh clean streak :((

please lmk so i can stop feeling guilty about it"
I've been thinking about hurting myself and others a lot lately,2,1,2025-09-08 21:11:10,"This year was the lowest I've ever been in, my girlfriend broke up with me in april and she was the only good thing in my life I have a reason to live for, I don't have any friends, I get constantly stomped on and harassed by people irl and online for no reason other than just existing, I already figured that god thinks Im not supposed to be alive hence why he always makes my life a living hell for no reason, the moment she broke up with me was the final straw, after years and years of torment from life I finally snapped, it was about serious depression at first, until I found out she found a new bf quite quickly.

It was one of her friends, she always got mad with me hating she has male friends and told me not to worry about it, this was the moment my depression disappeared and something in my brain snapped, I had way more suicidal thoughts than I ever had, I've been thinking some fucked up things to do to others around me, including my mentally insane family, Im way beyond saving when I think like that, I got really fucked the moment I was born, my destiny was to become a mentally unstable person with some fucked up shit in his brain.

I have so much rage in my body for all the 20 years Im alive, I need to harm someone, I fucking need it so bad, idc how I do it, I need to harm someone and fast."
Found out my therapist is f***** with my dad,51,43,2025-09-08 21:09:19,"I honestly don’t even know how to process this and I don’t even know why I’m writing here but my head is spinning and I can’t think straight. I’ve been seeing her for almost a year, and somewhere along the way I almost fell in love with her without even realizing it, because she made me feel safe for the first time in my life. I told her everything, every detail about my breakup, every fight with my dad, every insecurity I’ve ever had, every dark thought I couldn’t tell anyone else. She told me I was safe here, that I could trust her, that this was my space, and for the first time I actually believed someone.

**And today I find out she’s sleeping with my dad.**

I don’t even know what to feel because it’s everything at once it’s like my body can’t decide what to do so it’s doing everything all at once. My hands are shaking so hard I can barely type, my chest feels like it’s collapsing, and my heart has been racing since I found out. I don’t even know why but in the middle of this panic I opened this app a friend told me about MUUM because it supposedly tracks stress in real time, and seeing the little sphere go from blue to blood red instantly just made it worse, like my body’s been screaming at me this whole time and I didn’t even notice.

I keep replaying every session in my head, every time I cried in front of her, every secret I told her about him, and now I can’t stop thinking did she tell him? Were they talking about me while I was sitting there pouring my guts out? Did they laugh about me? Was the whole thing a fucking joke?

I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t even look at my dad without feeling like I’m going to throw up, and I have no idea what the fuck I’m supposed to do next. I feel humiliated, betrayed, disgusting, and completely alone.

Has anyone ever gone through anything even close to this? Because right now I feel like I’m losing my mind."
Coping tips?,1,0,2025-09-08 21:08:48,I'm still getting my meds fixed and I've almost got the right dosage but until then are they any coping tips I could do when I'm feeling down? anything that can maybe help me feel better or some things to avoid?
Does anyone else feel stuck between wanting joy and being weighed down by stress?,1,0,2025-09-08 21:07:07,"Lately I’ve been struggling with work and career. I feel stuck, like I should “do something” before moving forward, but I honestly don’t know what that is. Sometimes I wonder why I can’t just be like “normal” people who go to work and get on with it — even though many of them don’t seem happy either.

Instead, I find myself distracting myself with little things that aren’t really helpful. Part of me just wants entertainment, thrills, fun, security, good moments… but right now my life feels stressful and full of work and fears.

Even with jokes or laughter, I notice this weird split — it can feel healing, but also insensitive, like laughing while someone else is having a hard time. Still, I miss those moments when a laugh felt pure and good.

Does anyone else struggle with this mix of wanting joy while feeling stuck in stress and fear?"
Anyone ever gaslight themselves into thinking there was nothing wrong with them only to get diagnosed later?,1,0,2025-09-08 21:06:58,"Please I’m not doing good but there’s hardly any “proof” that it’s something else other than depression. My mind is conflicted and filled with so much negativity but when I calm down I gaslight myself into thinking it’s just all me. I’m lying, I’m being difficult. 

Has anyone experienced this and get diagnosed with something??"
I am seeking refuge from my misery to my imagination,1,0,2025-09-08 21:05:54,"I am imagining being in certain situations or having conversations with certain people who arent even in my life. I am indeed miserable in my life, but this is so pathetic and its giving me some happiness and refuge, and it became exessive. How mentally and emotionally sick am i ? Should i see a psychologist. I am simply runnig away from life. Infinite tsukoyumi"
Short memory,1,5,2025-09-08 21:01:34,"(Sorry if I will type everything weird I'm freaking out) 

My memory is so fucked up, I can't remember a shit. My mom actually said it's bullshit and I'm lying because back than I was alright. School's here and I'm stressed as fuck. I remember when I was already 6 I told my teacher I have bad memory. Or had to remember a song when I was 3 years old and coudn't. Each year I feel it's getting worse. I don't know what to do."
wanting to get worse?,1,9,2025-09-08 20:53:16,"i (20F) hate feeling depressed and i do not want to continue living like this, but at the same time i want things to get worse. i started some kind of online therapy bc i felt like maybe i need help, but i don't think it's very useful to me bc i don't actually want things to get better. i don't know how to explain this to my therapist, they are just like 'practice gratitude' or 'go outside everyday'. i want to stop going, i'm only wasting their time. i kinda regret i started in the first place.

i'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. i'm feeling stuck and i don't know what to do anymore. if anyone can relate or has some kind of advice i'm all ears"
"For some reason after therapy and opening up I feel no emotions, expressionless per say",1,0,2025-09-08 20:49:28,After opening up about my history with sucide and self harm it’s been a couple of days and now I feel detached and I get the urges still but I view them as almost not important and i didn’t even tell my mum and I feel like if I did it again I wouldn’t care I just push through those urges I guess
I think I’m becoming what I feared 21,1,0,2025-09-08 20:49:10,"I’ve been in car sales for about three months now and I've made more money than ever before. I’ve sold a lot of cars and have been the top performer. My brother got me this job, and recently I bought a motorcycle, so I'm fulfilling all my dreams. Meanwhile, I worry he feels stuck in 4th or 6th place, not making as much as me. He's many years older than me and has no car, and I feel so bad that I'm doing so well.

To get to the point, he makes jokes and I feel terrible because I don't always laugh. I'm drained sometimes. I just plain old make it seem like I don't care when I do. It makes me want to cry. The atmosphere here is very macho, and everyone pokes fun at each other. I think he feels excluded or he doesn't want to be that way. I'm always making fun of or poking fun at people as a joke, but I think it's going to turn into something else. I've hurt a few people doing this, and today I think I hurt my brother, the one who got me the job.

All the management here seems to reward the way I'm acting, as they are all this way. I don't want my brother to become depressed. I want to support him, but I can barely support myself. I want him to get a motorcycle. He keeps saying stuff like, ""While you have fun on your motorcycle, I’ll just sit at home and watch,"" and it breaks my heart. I think I'm a bad person. The money makes me feel so gross. I hate it all. Please give me some advice. I'm happy to answer questions as well.

TL;DR: I'm a new car salesman who is excelling, making lots of money, and fulfilling my dreams, but my older brother who got me the job is struggling and feels left behind. The office has a toxic, macho culture of making fun of each other, which I've participated in and think I've hurt him and others with. I feel terrible and don't know how to support him without sacrificing my own happiness or financial stability. I feel like a bad person and hate the money I'm making."
the only therapist that i’ve ever clicked with isn’t seeing patients anymore,1,0,2025-09-08 20:47:19,"So i’ve been in therapy since I was 8 years old for anxiety, depression, and ocd. I’ve seen like 7 different therapists in my lifetime, and absolutely none of them were helpful to me but one. i met my most recent one last year and they’ve been incredibly helpful and supportive for me. i’ve never felt more comfortable with a therapist and felt like i really could just tell them everything. they genuinely helped me heal so much and i finally felt like after all these years i found a therapist that i could actually see long term and truly trust. For the first time in my life i wasn’t dreading going to therapy because i was actually getting help from it and it was healing rather than anxiety inducing. but today my therapist emailed me that they got promoted and will not be seeing any patients anymore after a few weeks. Im not mad at my therapist by any means and i completely understand! this stuff happens obviously. but i would be lying if i said that i wasn’t really worried and a little sad. they want to work with me on finding someone new, so im appreciative about that. but i feel like ive seen so many therapists in my area that were, quite frankly, awful for me. and now, after finally finding someone i feel comfortable with, i have to restart all over again. i only have a couple more sessions with my therapist. this just feels so sudden and i feel broken to be honest. again i really want to stress that i am not mad or upset at my therapist of course, but i am just sad and worried. i don’t even know what to do. we had just started making progress and i felt so safe and secure. i just need some advice or i dont even know. i just feel alone right now. everyone talks about finding the therapist that’s right for them but what do you do when the only one you’ve clicked with is leaving? if anyone has any advice or just anything you think would be helpful to say i would truly appreciate it."
Don’t be so harsh,1,0,2025-09-08 20:46:46,"Don’t be so harsh on yourself, I know life can be tough, at times you may find yourself not even being able to get out of bed, and it’s easy to be your own worst critic. But I want to remind you that it’s okay to struggle, okay to feel tired, lost or even broken.

You don’t have to be crazy productive every day, progress is never a straight line and it is most definitely not a race. Every little step you take could be the chain reaction to a greater path, it matters more than you think.

Someone is wishing for you to reach your goals out there, and if you truly believe there isn’t, then I’m that person. I believe in you, you got this!"
I’m gonna be tested for early signs of psychosis tomorrow and I’m scared to sh!t,2,1,2025-09-08 20:46:33,"I’ve started going to a semi-stationary therapy a few weeks ago due to pretty heavy depression and they’ve told me they’ve seen me exhibit symptoms that make them concerned and remind them of certain cases they’ve had and now I’m being sent for an appointment to a psychosis-preventive facility (or that’s how it was explained to me) tomorrow. The problem is, they didn’t even explain me properly why, which makes me even more scared. They didn’t even want to use the term „psychosis“ but upon asking, they said that that is indeed what they mean. I myself don’t feel that way, or at least very much hope so, but what if it’s true, what if I’m actually one step away from a psychosis? Sure, there’s been depression in my family but never anything that serious. I thought I could learn to cope and live with my depression after the semi-stationary stay followed by regular behavioural psychotherapy but it might be not enough and more serious than that. I’m too scared to tell anybody. What if I am actually „going insane?“. What on earth do I do?"
Have you ever leaned on a pet to get through something?,1,0,2025-09-08 20:41:45,"I’m wondering if others have experienced this. A few years ago, I hit a really bad depressive patch. Medication wasn’t working, therapy felt stagnant, and the only thing that brought me peace was my cat. She would curl up on my chest and purr when I couldn’t get out of bed, or nudge me when I hadn’t eaten. It sounds small, but it felt like everything. I now help connect people with licensed clinicians at a platform called Wellness Wag (not selling anything, just context), and I’m amazed how many others share a similar story. These animals aren’t “emotional crutches”, they become grounding points. Have you ever thought about registering your pet as an ESA, even temporarily, but didn’t know how or whether it would feel “real”? I didn’t go into it thinking it would be life-changing, but it really was. Curious if anyone else has been there. Would love to hear your story, or feel free to DM if you’re not comfortable posting publicly."
How do I tell my family about going to the psych ward,1,0,2025-09-08 20:40:15,"I need to find a way to explain where I’m going without telling them where I’m going, I don’t want them to know they’ll try to stop me or just call me dramatic and to get over myself, my mums into all this holistic stuff and they both care a lot for my mental health but they will not accept me going to a hospital. 
What do I tell them instead? I’m so scared to be honest, there’s a lot more to this than you think."
Trying to be kind is so hard I cant take it anymore,1,1,2025-09-08 20:39:09,"Hello. My name is Deniz, and I'm 16 years old. I can't handle most things anymore. I know I'm very young and inexperienced, and it might just seem like typical teenage problems, but I can't take it anymore. Since I was little, I've constantly been bullied, left behind by my friends, or excluded. I've been diabetic since I was two and a half years old, and I need to take insulin five times a day. My family is in a bad financial situation, and because of that, I feel like I'm falling behind my friends, and they make me feel that way. I've been going to the gym for a year, but there isn't much change in my body, and they think I'm wasting my time and make fun of me. There are always two people who seem to gang up on me and bully me. They make fun of me for being bad at games, they make fun of my body, they make fun of my personality, and I don't think they would like me if I didn't entertain them sometimes. You might ask why I hang out with them then. We're in the same class and sit next to each other, that's the main reason, but I'm just not the type to be tough, I can't get angry, I can't throw a fit, I can't get upset. I always try to be nice to everyone, and I want to be remembered as a good person, and I try to be kind, but no one is kind or nice to me. Why does the world have to be filled with so many bad people? I can't take it anymore. My school is a vocational high school, and I'm studying electrical engineering, but I didn't come here willingly. They randomly assigned me to this school at first, and my dad forced me to go. I didn't actually want to go to vocational school. Anyway, I'm really bad at electrical engineering. Once, in the middle of class, I couldn't complete the circuit, and because I couldn't do it, my classmates bullied me. I tried to hold back my tears, but I couldn't hold them back. At least last year's teacher was a little kind and nice to me, but this year's teacher is terrible. He even made fun of me and broke my heart, and then my classmates did too. I act like they're not hurting me, but my heart is breaking. My hands hurt when hammering nails, and we stand for 6 hours while doing the circuit. It's also very hard because I go to school after sports. We don't have money, and I just watch videos when I come home, but I'm so bored now. I'm such a fool. Even though I study, my grades are average, but my friend gets better grades than me with less effort. I want to go to university, but I don't think I can do it. I feel like I'm going to fail the exam. This exam is my only chance, and I'm so scared. I can't handle this pressure. I don't understand why I have to go through this at such a young age. I don't feel like I belong anywhere or to anyone. I have disgusting sides to me that I hide from everyone, and that's why the urges get even stronger. I constantly engage in maladaptive daydreaming. In class, at home, at sports, everywhere. Even if I'm not daydreaming, I just zone out. I can't tell people this. I want to go to a psychologist, but I can't tell my family; no one can. I don't know if I'm depressed, but I constantly think pessimistically. I can't enjoy anything properly. On top of that, when I want to hang out with my friends to take my mind off things, their bullying really makes me cry. I can't be a good big brother. My sister says she wishes she had a different big brother. I'm crying as I write this. Please, someone help me. I can't take it anymore."
I'm really trying to stay positive but it's getting hard again,1,4,2025-09-08 20:33:45,"I've had to move back to my mother's house momentarily cause I'm waiting for the lease on a new apartment. 


Everytime I'm there I'm not in a good mental place and it's really hard to stay positive with the prospect that I'll have to be here for 2 more months. 

I'm going out as much as possible and sleeping over at friends places but it basically unavoidable to sleep here sometimes. 

I'm pretty close to leaving and just sleeping in my car for the time being. 

I just don't want to fall back into the hole I worked years to get myself out of."
My girlfriend suddenly started talking weirdly.,10,27,2025-09-08 20:28:11,"I, 22 (M) and my Girlfriend is 20 (F),  she lately started talking weirdly. When there is an arguement between us, she suddenly starts saying like ""let's go home"", "" I have to go home"" ( even though she is already at her home). ""who are you"", "" take me to home"". I'm kinda fucked up, I don't why this all is happening? Is this any mental illness?? Please someone help me!."
My Mom hid her cancer from me for years then told me to guilt trip me,1,0,2025-09-08 20:26:04,"This story sounds so unbelievable, but I was very depressed and I just didn't want to go outside. I'd stay in my room all the time, and one day my mom told me we were going to the mall. I said, ""No, I don't want to go to the mall!"" We yelled a lot, and I slammed the door in her face. Later, she came into my room crying. Mind you, I had never seen my mother cry until that moment. She said, ""Do you know that I've been sick for the past few years?"" and she proceeded to say, ""I have been sick with breast cancer for the past few years, and I just found out I'm clear. How could you treat me like this while I was sick? You're such a bad daughter. How could you be such a bad child while I was sick? Do you know how hard it was for me?"" My jaw was on the floor, and I didn't know what to say. Because I truly didn't know she had cancer since I was in high school. I remember feeling like the worst person in the world. Until my friend explained to me that what my mom did was manipulation. But only a year later did I realize how terrible this was. No, I was not an unruly teenager; I didn't do drugs, never drank, never went to parties. I mean, hell, I used to read books and write poems! But after high school, I was very sad, and I just didn't want to go outside. After she dropped that bomb, I went to the mall with her. She pretended it didn't happen, and I pretended I wasn't sad anymore. Now I feel uncomfortable around her. I don't tell her anything about my life. I don't trust her, and she irritates me. Can I please have someone tell me if I'm overreacting? I genuinely just don't like being around her."
Why do I feel extremely depressed at 8pm-Midnight everyday?,1,2,2025-09-08 20:25:20,"I literally cannot figure it out. Like, I feel ok during the day and then my mood will completely plummet at 8pm. I can't move because it's too much, I can't do anything, I can't even cry I'm just so numb and down. Even if I'm in the middle of something, it'll still hit, knock me down like a ton of bricks. 

Then midnight happens and my mood gradually lifts. I usually feel a bit better by 2am, annoyingly just when I'm too tired to enjoy it lol 

But I dread it everyday, I keep hope that one day it won't happen but it always does unless I'm at the pub 💀 but that's just Saturday night. Maybe something in the alcohol just prevents it? Idk but obviously I ain't gonna do that every night. 

But yes, please help because I'm completely losing hope and my psychiatrist isn't listening to my concerns (I've already reported the mistreatment, my mum sits in on appointments and she agrees that he just doesn't listen.) So I'm kinda on my own with dealing with this. But please feel free to ask any questions because I'm genuinely desperate to get to the bottom of this 😭"
"I’m sick, wish I could hire a mom.",13,5,2025-09-08 20:24:00,"Maybe there is a service like this but I wish I could hire a woman older than me to care for me when I am sick or after surgery. I can barely take care of myself. I have food but making it is exhausting. 
She would tell me I’m going to be alright, cook for me, check my temperature and help me remember medicine. 

I think I would get better faster if someone cared."
i want some advice/guidance on being alone,1,1,2025-09-08 20:23:50,"hi this is my first post here idk where to look for advice in the situation i am
so i ve always struggled with the fear of ending up alone but i also push away the people that care about me
recently i ve pushed away and i ve been horrible to this group of friends i had. i apologized to one of the friends but she told me she needs a break for an indefinite period of time. i was the closest to her so i doubt the other friends would have a positive reaction to my apology.
so that leaves me alone. i don't really have any other friends to hand out or talk to, i don't have a job at the moment to maybe socialize with coworkers, i talk to my parents but not about this kind of stuff 
what im asking is some advice/guidance/tips on dealing with being alone with myself and with my thoughts. in this time alone i also want to work on dealing with my emotions"
Unsure how to deal with my particular issues - would really like some advice,1,2,2025-09-08 20:18:20,"Long story short - my anxiety and depression started in May due to an acute health crisis. I was having severe GI issues that I could not explain that basically reduced my quality of life to zero within a few days. It was/is super scary and while I'm a lot more stablized now and am being treated for these physical issues, I still feel a huge amount of fear and anxiety. It's like before when my illness was bad and I didn't have any answers I was 100% focused on worrying about my health and now that that is begining to resolve I don't feel as consciously worried about that but it's like I have this huge amount of fear still that doesn't know where to go.

The result is that my anxiety at this point is just mostly kind of unspecific and free-floating but follows general themes. Often times I just feel a vague general sense of fear and unease and it's like my brain searches for things to latch onto and be anxious about and that can change day to day and literally feels so random, but I also am feeling plagued by memories from early on and right before my illness even though they aren't inherently bad or scary. It's like my mind connects the things that were happening in my life right before I got sick to me actually getting sick and now it scares me to think of those things, which just makes them come to mind even more. I've tried intentionaly turning towards the thoughts/memories and just letting them come and go and I have days where I feel like it's getting better and days when I feel like it's not. Granted it has only been a couple months, but I really want to feel ok again...

I've been reading various self help books and about different strategies but not sure what would ""fit"" my situation. Recently been reading David Burns' book ""Feeling Great"" and I really like the concepts of his methods but I just don't know how to apply them to myself because I'm not consciously having thoughts like ""I'm a bad person"" or whatever. I'm just kind of generally scared and anxious. I guess if I had to put my underlying fear into words, it's that I am not going to be able to get or feel better due to the memories (even though they aren't inherently bad) and my illness. But it feels nonsensical and vague so I don't even know how to challenge it. Does anyone have any ideas?"
Dealing with a food phobia,1,1,2025-09-08 20:18:04,"I am 19, and dealing with OCD and other anxiety disorders. Five months ago I just moved out of my parent's house. I thought I was in controll of my life but honestly it doesn't feel like that anymore.
I have a fear of throwing up and vomit ever since I was a kid, since I get sick easily and it happend a couple of time.
Recently I have been developing some other fears regarding food, and hygine.
Most days I force myself to eat and cook for myself, and if I can't I get take out, but recently I get so scared of throwing up I just skip meals. If I don't have a very specific type of food for the moment I can get anxious while eating resulting in gag reflex.
I have been in therapy for a while but it's hard for me to manage life like that.
If any of you dealt with anything simillar please help."

I heard it multiple times, but I checked my whole room and nothing. I'm so tired of this I just want to sleep but I can't even escape these feelings in sleep.

Music has always helped me heal — I wrote my first song hoping it can help someone else too,1,2,2025-09-08 20:02:04,"Hi all,  
Music has always been one of the things that helped me through my toughest moments. Writing my first single, *Fractured Lines*, was a way of turning heavy emotions into something that gave me strength.

I’m now working on an EP that continues this story — about growth, self-acceptance, and rebuilding after struggles.

I’m sharing this here in case it resonates with anyone going through their own challenges. You can find *Fractured Lines* on Spotify under *Nozul*.

Wishing you all healing and hope on your journeys. 💙

Books to help with insecurity,1,0,2025-09-08 19:52:46,Hi everyone! Does anyone have any good book recommendations to help with overcoming feelings of insecurity? Thank you in advance! X
Quitting Nicotine is destroying me,2,0,2025-09-08 19:51:43,"This is my first time posting here and frankly I am really losing it, Reddit. 

For some background: I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder and Clinical Depression at 14. I have learned to cope on my own without medications or therapy for a very long time, mainly due to necessity (shitty insurance, time constraints, fear of being put on medications as I've had a bad reaction when I was quite young). I have never been diagnosed with anything in regards to my anger as 99% of the time its absolutely controllable and at worst im just overly snippy. I have a history of self-harm but have been ""clean"" for many years (almost a decade).

Now we get into the current situation and I feel like all the work and coping mechanisms I've had in place have just shattered. I'm absolutely full of rage, self-hate, and bordering on some really disturbing thoughts. I started smoking cigarettes and Marijuana at 18. I quit Marijuana at 21, and at the same time I switched from cigarettes to vaping. Im now 29 (almost 30) and due to a variety of reasons, im needing to quit vaping all together. I was a HEAVY vapor. About a month ago I bought my last e-cig. Three weeks ago I tried to quit cold turkey and three days in I found a vape that still had some juice and it lasted two weeks and I tried to not vape as much (which i did manage to cut down quite a bit). I threw out quite a few I still had lying around, but I still have a small stash of mostly empty ones that I've been using sparingly. My husband thought I tossed them all.... but I didnt....

A week ago I got another three days in and I cracked. I just took a few puffs for the first few days but over this weekend ive fallen back into taking a few hits once every few hours. 

Today, something changed. I woke up so full of rage I was practically vibrating with it. I scared the shit out of my husband because he walked into my office and I gave him the nastiest look I've ever given him and he just walked out. We only spoke twice before he left for work and I couldn't control myself. I snapped so hard at him and he did nothing wrong... and I absolutely hate myself for it. The second he left for work i went and dug one out....

I'm not like this. I'm not someone who just loses my mind on people I love like this. I don't even feel like me anymore. Im hiding the stash of vape from him, sneaking puffs when hes not in the room. I feel like a fucking junkie. 

I don't know if I can do this. I don't want to do this. I've tried gum anytime I get a craving and it helps a bit but its not the same. I can't focus at work and im afraid ill lose my job if I end up snapping on someone. I feel like I should just lock myself away for a few weeks just so I don't say something I can't take back. 

What the hell do I do? I know I need to get rid of them all but I don't know if I have the strength to do this and I can't tell my husband because he'll be so upset with me I think he'll leave and I wouldn't blame him if he did...."
Trying but failing,2,0,2025-09-08 19:50:56,"I always try to see a greater meaning in everything. Didn’t get the job? Better one coming. Kicked out of school? Apply elsewhere. Parents hate you? Learn self love and help others in a similar situation. Get sexually abused by your step sister? Learn to deal with betrayal and become a stronger person.

Life stops for nobody. This past year I struggled everyday and I try over and over and over again to make myself a better person, make my life better. Get a new job, new apartment, work part time instead, take a break from school, try medication, start therapy. Nothing. Works. I have been through hell and STILL TO THIS DAY I get up and try despite everything. What is the point anymore. I hit a block. Is god even real? I never hear him or see him or sense him. If something doesn’t work out I try again do it differently then try something else. What else can I do? What purpose does this serve? How is me suffering and trying 1 million times harder than anybody else making me a better person or worth anything? It’s not. So what’s the point?"
How do you get out of bed when you're anxious?,2,1,2025-09-08 19:49:08,"I woke up this morning and felt so anxious that my heart couldn't stop racing. All these things I had to do, and all the things I didn't do, made it seem like the end of the world. Can someone tell me what they did to handle their anxiety in the morning? Grounding techniques help for ten minutes, and then it's back to spiralling."
"I want to feel alive, once again",1,0,2025-09-08 19:48:40,"I'm entering my 20s, and went through a breakup recently after being together for 3 years. Though my mental health is so worse nowadays that the breakup didn't even impact me much. I have been suffering from chronic depression for no reason at all for some months now. 
It's hard for me to go to counselling. Even if I vent to my friends and get similar sob stories nothing really changes in me. I'm a pretty well known person in my community and people of my age respect me—but still I feel bad, I feel depressed. And I can't figure it out why I'm depressed. I have a good family, caring parents, good friends but sometimes I feel this heaviness on my chest. I do have goals, and they are achievable, but this depression is making it all messed up in my mind. 

I see posts like get a disciplined life, have drive, stop social media, and so on, but eventually due to this state of my mind, I can't even focus on improving myself. I'm feeling like I'm done with my life. I have religious questions, I have career ideas, I have things to do, but this state of mind makes me want to just leave everything."
A message for anyone who needs to hear this today,1,2,2025-09-08 19:45:21,"I just want to remind you that everything will be okay. Whatever you’re going through right now, it’s not the end of your story. We’re all here for a reason, and your life matters more than you realize.

Yes, life throws painful experiences our way. Yes, there are days when it feels like the whole world is against us. But that’s not the truth. There are people out there rooting for you, even if you don’t know them personally. And there is always someone who loves you, even if it doesn’t feel like it.

If nobody has told you today: I love you. I believe in you. And I want you to keep going. You’re stronger than you think, and the world is better with you in it.

Have a gentle day, and take care of yourself. ❤️"
Is it depression if I can go from feeling completely hopeless and down to feeling okay(not exactly happy but fine)in just a few hours ?,1,0,2025-09-08 19:42:37,"I’ve recently realized that my mood is all over the place. I can go from feeling really depressed to feeling okay and even hopeful — all within a few hours. For a while, I thought I might have depression, but I don’t seem to meet all the criteria for clinical depression.

For example, today I felt *really* down at uni — just this overwhelming loneliness, emptiness, and this feeling like no one could help me. But weirdly, after my lectures I felt totally fine again. Then I got home, and those depressed feelings came back out of nowhere.

This has been happening for years, and it’s honestly exhausting. It’s hard to enjoy the moments when I feel good because I know that “down” feeling can hit me again at any time."
This is a mix of a vent and like just to see if this is normal idk,1,0,2025-09-08 19:42:20,"Im a nearly 16 year old girl. I know its normal to be a bit emotional and stuff especially around your period but I just dont know how to handle it. I’ll be completely fine for a week or so and then I’ll randomly break down one evening and get mad over everything, start sobbing and genuinely just hating everything around me. Like even a tiny sound or a small tjing going wring would make me even more upset. I’ll hit myself and things around me and ill shout and stuff idk how to like talk aboyt this kinda stuff sorry for the awkward wording.
Ik usually this would just be blamed on your period, but this dosent really happen at specific times or anywhere near my period really. 
I guess it could just be stress cause im in year 11 and i have GCSE’s this year but this has also been happening for years.
I just wish this didn’t happen i hate being mad and I usually just end up hurting my family even tho I dont mean to"
Bed rotting,1,0,2025-09-08 19:37:34,"I’m not sure if this has ever happened to anyone else. As a kid I was very active, but anxiety made my life worse and I stopped playing. Still did gym class of course and the occasional summer activities. 

Now I’m fourteen and lay in my bed 90% of the time, and if I’m not in bed I’m in someone else’s like my grandmothers or sitting down somewhere. I’ve had a bad bit of depression these past few months so I know what’s why I’m a bit worse, like I can’t get up even just to draw or whatever. It hurts. 

I got bloodwork done for something unrelated and they said my muscles may be deteriorating from lack of exercise and stuff like that. It’s almost embarrassing to be honest. I never thought that could be a possibility, I guess? I have talked to my doctor about it yet, waiting for an appointment but still I’m pretty worried. And stubborn. I don’t like exercising, it’s exhausting and I’d rather do a million other things. Maybe my muscles are okay, but you know, nobody wants to think about something being wrong with them."
Silent mind,1,1,2025-09-08 19:36:02,"All I have ever really wanted was for my mind to be quiet. I’m exhausted by how loud it is in my head, tired of the never ending thoughts. I had a short moment of peace because of a person that seemed genuinely kind to me. Now that they left, there’s no peace. There’s no quiet anymore. I don’t know how much longer I can keep going like this, I can’t even sleep because the constant thoughts are like pounding hammers in my brain. Nothing helps or stops it. I’m tired.. I’ll get my quiet it’s just a matter of just how permanently.."
I really struggle when my close friends are busy and I know its stupid,1,0,2025-09-08 19:34:35,"I really struggle when my friends are busy or I'm left out of activities that don't interest me, or they are busy doing other things. I know its ridiculous I think its the lack of control and worrying why I'm genuinely not involved in certain things I ended up questioning why.

I have a fairly large friendship group 8-10 people which I'd mostly describe as being gamer nerds but the cool type that wash and actually go to social events haha - No offence intended. Some of the group I've known best part of 20 years others between 5 - 10 years.  There's a core 4-5 of us then the others form the rest of the group. The core group are/were until recently online most days. We are all in a big Facebook group chat. We do meet up to play boardgames, go out drinking, go shopping, movies or sports events etc and have a yearly holiday together. As the years have gone by some of the group aren't as local anymore having moved away.

Most of us work from home and we share a lot of interests so between work meetings and work commitments we spend a lot of time online on discord chatting. As you can imagine when the world was locked up during covid this was an ideal thing for us. For many years we used to play a lot of online games. Gaming is the primary reason most of us are friends we met through a Lan Gaming Centre.

As people are getting older commitments have changed so the day times, evenings and weekends online are becoming quieter and less, though sometimes some of my friends will be online with others just chatting about other things in other discords or playing other games. Recently its become VERY quiet and I've found myself lost on a lot of evenings. Its a real struggle to cope. I'm a very active guy who goes  to the gym a lot, I don't feel I need to take on other activities to keep me busy etc.

I've battled with mental health issues the last few years and I am seeking diagnosis which can take a long time in the UK. I have a few life long medical conditions too so I know my mind is unique and the way I think and feel differs from others. I absolutely like routine and its the change I'm finding hard. I'm quite lucky that my job allows me flexible hours so I can finish work, go to the gym and then pick up my kids. This often leaves me a lot of evenings free to be online or play games when kids are in bed. My wife and I put 2 nights a week aside to spend time together so 5 nights I just like to sit online doing my thing and she'll do her own thing. Only one other friend has children but the rest are on the way to having some.  Tonight one of my  friends is online but he's with a group I don't really know and they're doing their thing which involves another hobby/interest I don't care for.

I think what worries me to is the fact that I've given so much to my friends and I don't want our friendships to dwindle out or not be as important as they once were. Its weird range of emotions that I don't know how to process. I'll always be the friend to lend money, help write a CV, fix a car, give a lift or suggest a meet up. As I'm up early with two kids I'm always the first to post in the group chat. Anyway thanks for listening/reading :-)"
HOCD or denial ?,2,1,2025-09-08 19:33:26,I’ve been awful again today and banged my head on the wall. All because I was feeling relaxed and pre HOCD towards same sex abd why does this relaxed feeling make it feel like a real crush??!!!! I try not to solve it but not solving it feels like denial cos I don’t want to admit it’s real cos feel relaxed abd natural towards same swx. The crushy feelings feel the same as I felt for guys but then I try to fight and suppress these. Is this HOCD ?
I feel like I'm being excluded. What do I do?,3,3,2025-09-08 19:29:33,"I'm in a Discord group and I'm not sure what is going on. I post my art I pour my heart and soul into and barely get a ""Nice"" (most likely out of pity, and even then, nobody says anything beyond that) but someone else posts some chicken scratch they made in ten minutes and they get praise heaved upon them.

It seems almost everyone else is invited to a Stream voice chat except me. I ask for an explanation and they give a mealy-mouthed ""nothing personal.""

Some members even get preferential treatment, going into voice channels and setting limits so ridiculously small and only expanding for certain other people.

I get the feeling most of the people in the server see me as a monster but aren't willing to say it. And it seems even the people who are nice to me have to walk on eggshells.

Honestly, a big problem is when most of the people there have mental problems or mental breakdowns, they get special attention. 

But when I have mental problems or a mental breakdown, I'm hushed, ignored, and suddenly everyone acts like they have no idea how to handle it.

Is this all in my head or what do I do?"
How does one go about self-therapy?,1,1,2025-09-08 19:28:25,"I’m just gonna start off by saying that I think going to a therapist can be very helpful, but I think most people who’ve really looked into this knows that there’s a lot of serious problems with the way that it’s structured in our society. How hard it is to find a genuinely good therapist that isn’t going to brake your wallet in the process. I believe that I’m introspective and thoughtful enough to make strides in my journey at least for now. I know that journaling is a huge part of it, and from what I hear workbooks are also very useful as well. I’m also curious what kinds kinds of well respected resources are out there. I want to learn how to build true community around me to give me the right space to really look at my traumas and negative thoughts and patterns. As well as the tools necessary for deep introspection. Advice would be appreciated."
What’s wrong with me?,1,0,2025-09-08 19:27:40,"I don’t know how to put anything into words. I thought I would be getting a call today for an assessment, they didn’t call. I hope they call soon because I am going back and forth with knowing there’s something wrong with me and believing that I am just lying for attention or to get out of living, im a loser and pathetic I can’t stop these thoughts and I’m tired of it. I’m not sure what’s going on in my head or how to even explain it to the psychiatrist when I get the call. What do I even say? How do I put this into words when it’s empty but full at the same time?"
How do you stop feeling like your brain is stuck on repeat,2,0,2025-09-08 19:26:59,"I am 19 and lately it feels like my brain is stuck on the same cycle every single day. I wake up tired no matter how much I sleep. I tell myself I am going to be productive but then I just end up scrolling on my phone or zoning out. By the end of the day I feel guilty for not doing enough, then promise myself tomorrow will be better but it just happens all over again.

It makes me feel like I am wasting my age and my life, even though I know 19 is still young. I have friends but I often cancel plans because I feel drained. Sometimes I even question if I am lazy or if this is a sign of something bigger like depression.

Has anyone else felt stuck in this loop? How did you break out of it or at least make it easier to cope? I would love to hear personal experiences because right now it feels like I am the only one going through this."

 The moment I walked in the laundry mat there was a man sitting down who looked to be around 50 something years old sitting In one of the seats , I looked at him for a split second , once we locked eyes he covered his mouth. Or he already had his mouth covered?  You could see he was trying to hold back laughter. I made my way over to one of those carts and I was able to get a view of the guy from behind  those long bars you grab onto that are attatched to the carts themselves , he was watching me , when we locked eyes again he turned back around ASAP but he tried to get one more glance before turning back around , if I'm not mistaken he started laughing again. Not the first time something like this has happened , I remember some dude in his 20s or late teens held an air pocket in his mouth with a smile across his face the min he looked at me , I immediately looked away from him. in a room of 10 people 6 of them will visibly struggle to hold on their laugh while the other 4 just won't give a shit and do it in my face. Does it hurt? A little little bit HOWEVER its moreso annoying than painful at this point. Like dude ,I get it  I am a hideous creature , you just can't believe that some can look like this huh? Like seriously I should be getting paid for the way I look since im so fuckin interesting to look at.  Seriously though , At this point I dont even take my anxiety medications , I only did that shit consistently for like a month or so then dropped the ball due to procrastination or just flat out giving up. Even the middle aged woman at fucking CVS , she had a face mask on but you could still see her eyes smiling which initially I thought she was just being nice but as we walked past eachother it was a stare down and she smiles wide asf and started chuckling. Either way , I'm not in emotional pain. Ive been trying to cope with the ending of a half ass ""relationship"" I got myself into a while ago , it spiked up my OCD bad!!!! I mean its really bad to where I have to write down in a note pad the events of anything thats important to me or else my mind will replay it incorrectly and ruin my entire week/month. Maybe I dont have OCD , I'm likely just lying to myself to cope with the fact that all the best moments in life where lies , tricks and illusions. What got me Thinking I ever had OCD to begin with was my first kiss. It was an unexpected tounge kiss and I was 100% convinced that it happened. I was thrilled about it up until a day or two later I replayed it in my head many many times and picked up on some things. Like I started remembering certain details pertaining to how it felt such as tempature , feeling duration etc. at some point I began to remember the kiss being a bit cold and thought ""mouths aren't cold though"" , maybe it was from the drink she had though. Another time i asked myself if she just moved out of the way in time and I was actually kissing something else , I wondering if she put her hand between us , I started to wonder if I forced her to kiss me , I started to wonder if I made her uncomfortable ,  And recently I started wondering if I lied about any tounge being involved. Tbh I did exaggerate one thing to a friend of mine but it was something else I don't remember what though but it was something mild and stupid"
how do i cope with my anger :(,1,0,2025-09-08 19:21:29,"(my english isn’t perfect so i apologise for some confusion in a few sentences) 

My whole life, I’ve been labelled as the angry child by my family. They often mistook my tone/action as rude or disrespectful. Don’t get me wrong, I love my family they’re my everything, my world. It’s just that I felt like my feelings were often pushed aside, not being heard and taken seriously because I’m the youngest one.

Now as I grew up, with all the feelings I’ve bottled up all these years. I became someone who always feels enraged, annoyed, angry and easily upset. I tend to not lash out on my family because that’ll just prove their point. I would only feel this way when literally anyone even just ASSUME that I’m mad, I’m filled with so much anger. 

I hate being mad at people, the guilt after would always be heavy to me. I can’t talk about this to anyone not even a friend because I’m scared they won’t understand. That because I’ve tried talking about it with one of my siblings but instead they invalidate my feelings. All I’m asking is to be heard and understood, I want them to know I’m not talking back to them but I’m simply defending myself as an individual who was misunderstood. 

Seeing a therapist is crazy expensive where I live. (Malaysia), I’ve searched up online the cheapest I could find is around RM210 for a consultation. (that’s around 50 USD doesn’t sound much but trust me, it’s a lot. Specially for someone who’s a student with no income at all) I don’t know how else to cope with this. I used to >! self harm !< (trigger warning), but I quit 10 months ago. The urges are still there but I tried to find an alternative and a healthier way like going for a run to let everything out but it’s never the same than doing *it*. 

I really want to be a better person. I hate feeling like this towards my family and friends, i hate having a secret negative feelings towards them. I wish to not feel this way anymore."
I don't know what to do,1,5,2025-09-08 19:16:03,"I feel anxious and scared about everything. If something seems dangerous or if I feel like I've done something wrong, I want to hurt myself.

I feel guilty about my life and about who I am.,1,0,2025-09-08 19:09:22,"Hi, I’m 22 years old and close to finishing my bachelor’s degree. I’m not sure if I’ll actually finish on time because I struggle a lot with writing my thesis. I can’t seem to motivate myself to sit down and work on it, and I end up hating myself for that. I only went to university because my parents pushed me to go right after high school instead of taking a gap year. I chose English philology because it seemed “easy,” but I really dislike it. Still, once I started, I felt like I couldn’t quit. Now I carry a lot of guilt for not being motivated enough to study hard. My parents both have degrees, and for me it was more of an obligation than a choice. I don’t know what I want to do in life. I don’t really have goals. My grandfather also expects me to go on and complete a master’s degree. I feel like my life is being dictated by other people, but at the same time I don’t want to seem ungrateful. My grandfather couldn’t go to university because of the war, even though he was accepted to study law at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. He worked incredibly hard and built our family’s wealth. At my age, he had three jobs and worked from 6 AM until midnight. I don’t want to let my family down. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, but sometimes I feel like I’m just being ungrateful. I tried therapy for a few sessions and took medication, but I stopped once I felt better. Unfortunately, that didn’t last. I started smoking weed more often and later moved on to opioids. I quit everything in January, but now I feel this huge emptiness inside. There are also things from my past that I don’t usually talk about. When I was 8 or 9, a friend molested me, though at that age I didn’t even understand what sex was. Something similar happened again when I was 16, and another incident when I had just turned 18. I tell myself these experiences didn’t affect me much, but maybe they did. At 17, I also struggled with an eating disorder, though I’m in a better place with food now. Still, despite all this, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just an ungrateful brat. Every time I open up about being depressed, people look at me with confusion, as if it doesn’t make sense. Friends tell me that my life would be their dream come true, and in some ways, they’re right. My parents love me deeply and would give me everything. I’ve traveled to many countries with them. My grandfather bought me a car when I turned 18 and two houses to chose to live in whenever I want, and even gave me a piece of land to keep or sell. On paper, I have everything anyone could want, but inside, I still feel lost, guilty, and broken. I’m sorry if this post is chaotic but i needed to tell someone about my situation."
how to talk with parents about adhd?,2,0,2025-09-08 19:07:39,"i know it may sound dumb but lately i was thinking about adhd, my whole family from my mom's side has either OCD or ADHD.

Could really use some advice,1,1,2025-09-08 19:04:10,"Will start this off by saying trigger warnings for SH, so if you are sensitive to that then please dont read.


hi, im looking for advice on a situation my family is currently in. My sister, 20F, is currently really struggling mentally. For a bit of context, she currently lives at home without a job and stopped education without completing her A levels. This was due to a mix of reasons, but most of them lead back to overwhelming social anxiety, bad sensory issues caused by autism, as well as bad bullying that had happened at school. Since this time, my family, but particularly my mum, has done absolutely everything in her power to help her. She was sent as a voluntary patient to the priory a few years ago, but didn't seem to necessarily help her a lot. My mum has also made probably hundreds of appointments at this point with various mental health orgs and professionals, but my sister almost always refuses to go to these, as she struggles too much with leaving the house and confronting stressful situations. Right now she can leave the house for small amounts of time, mainly to see my dad every weekend for about an hour. She also occasionaly will go to the pub with us, although she does say how stressful she finds it and can only go out for very small amounts of times. She has been self harming on and off for a long time, and as I am her brother who has been at uni for the past 2 years I don't have specific details of the complete severity of it, but I know its atleast relatively consistent. In the recent days, shes effectively stopped eating completely, I suspect shes doing more violent self harm, and seems so incredibly down and depressed (more than she usually is). If I haven't highlighted the severity of the situation enough, my mother is considering getting her sectioned, as she (as am I) am incredibly worried about her safety. Because she really avoids any sort of change in scenery or day to day life, she would absolutely hate and probably not forgive us if this went through. It would atleast in part ruin my relationship with her, and im sure it would also completely destroy the relationship she has with my mum. We are her only friends so I don't know if doing this would make her feel more isolated and alone, but it feels like its gotten to the boiling point where we are out of ideas. I would love any advice on this matter, or more specifically if anyone has any stories or experience with being sectioned in the UK, and whether it has the ability to genuinely help her. If this isn't the right subreddit to be asking in then I apologise, and would really appreciate if someone would beable to point me in the right direction. I am happy to sacrifice any relationship I have with her if it means she will get better, and im sure my mum would tell you the same thing. I want to reiterate we have literally tried every single other option. She refuses any sort of help and has a complete unwillingness to engage in activities that might help her get better."

Lack of motivation,1,0,2025-09-08 18:57:04,"I have no motivation to do tasks for university and it’s scaring me. The tasks seem complicated which kills my motivation to even start. I feel incapable of doing any of it. I was a good student in high school and did all the work because it was much simpler. During the lectures I look forward to getting home and it feels like I attend them because I “need” to. I like my major but I just wanna lay in my bed, watch tv and eat. I know that’s crazy.

I don’t know what to do with this life,2,3,2025-09-08 18:27:33,"I’m 22 year old female. I feel like this is last resort because I can’t do the 9-5 anymore even tho it’s actually 7:30-5. 40 minute drive home. I make 18.50/hr which is the most I’ve ever made thus far in life. I was a problem child growing up. I didn’t care about my grades or homework and nothing motivated me. My mom would try to take my phone away and that didn’t even help. I didn’t think I’d graduate and I had to go to an alternative school my sophomore year just so I could graduate. Moved out at 18. 20-21 I was so depressed I didn’t work for almost a year and I still feel disgusting for allowing myself to get that bad. My mom took care of me. Truly blessed and privileged to have such an amazing mom and dad. Now I’m working a desk job in a tiny office. I’m finding it very difficult to want to be here. I just want to sit on my porch and feel the sun. I’ve struggled my whole life being told what to do. It gives me an immense amount of anxiety feeling like I have to appease someone constantly (mom+dad, boss, bf) I don’t wanna be told what to do and I know that sounds so selfish but I’m not a person who does well with routine or habits. I feel so stuck. I feel a lump in my throat just writing this. I’ve gone to therapy every week for 2 years and I take medication every day and it helps but it kinda just feels like bandaid on a bullet wound. I want more in this life but it feels like it’s not gonna happen for me because I don’t care to try harder. My mind can’t comprehend making myself miserable for months or years in order to gain “freedom” but ur never really free. More money= more problems right? I’m not gonna harm myself or anything of the sort but it is really hard not to spiral into that thought process. Why suffer when I could just start over is kinda what it feels like. I’m doing better than when I was 20 and the meds do help make it so my emotions don’t feel so detrimental. But the feeling and ideas of the sad reality of it all are still very strong and very present. I constantly shame myself because people do have it so much worse than me and I’d give my life away for anyone who wanted it more than me. I could talk and talk for hours about all of this. The world is on fire around me and people are still drinking their matcha lattes. I feel everything all the time. I hate seeing people hurt. I hate feeling hurt. I feel helpless to others and myself. I feel like I’m here for no reason. Why would I stay? Idk. If you’ve made it this far I guess thank you for reading a strangers thoughts. Please don’t judge me although I completely understand if you do because maybe this all comes off as a victim mindset? Does anyone have suggestions on how to make this life worth living? How can I make enough money to sustain myself financially while also feeling like I’m not completely giving my whole life away to some job. I just want my time. I just wanna wake up and decide what I’d like to do with my day. Am I asking too much? Maybe I’m just not built for this world and it’s systems. I can’t imagine doing this another five years. I can’t imagine doing this even just another year. It’s really easy for me to spiral into a dark place. Whatever I need to stfu now. Thanks for anyone who made it this far. I hope you aren’t feeling like this either and I hope that this life is beautiful the way it’s supposed to be for you."
"I feel stuck in a pattern of loss, and it’s messing with my head",2,1,2025-09-08 18:19:46,"Hi everyone,
This is a bit hard to write, but I really need to let it out somewhere.

For the past couple of years, I’ve noticed a strange and painful pattern — people close to me, or even just around me at work, keep passing away. And it almost always happens in September.

It started in September 2024. One of my colleagues lost his mom due to a medical error. Just a few days later, another coworker lost her dad in an accident. Then, a few weeks after that, my own uncle died in the most shocking way — he was riding his motorcycle when a lorry carrying rice bags tipped over and fatally hit him. It still doesn’t feel real. Around the same time, I also lost my job

Now it's September 2025. I’ve started a new job and have been trying to move forward. But just last Friday, a senior colleague who sits right next to me lost his father. And today, I found out a close family friend passed away from a heart attack.

I don’t know if this is just coincidence, or if my mind is trying to find patterns, but every time September comes around, I feel this heavy sense of dread — like I’m bracing for something bad to happen. I can’t stop overthinking it. I feel mentally drained, anxious, and honestly a little scared.

Has anyone else experienced something like this — where grief or loss seems to come in waves, or around the same time each year? How do you deal with it and stop your mind from spiraling?

(28M, India — for context)"
I lost control.,2,5,2025-09-08 18:19:08,"Hi, 

I cant believe I have to ask for help over this, but today I totally lost control over myself and self harmed for the 1st time ever. Normally when I get extremely anxious I scrach myself but never ever ever make myself bleed. Today, I just gabbed a facial shaver and used the blade over and over until it really hurt me. Luckily none of the cuts are deep or ""serious"" but it looks scary, I look scary. I cant recognise myself. I know is stupid. But at the same time I keep wondering why did I do it. Is it because im craving for attention? Do I want people to notice it? or did I do it because I really hate myself that much and will it happen again? I am ashamed of walking out of my room and let my flatmates to see me like that, im not even trying to cover it but for a couple seconds im like ""Yes, this is because of what you told me affected me so much"" and its fucking scary. Yes they did fucked up things to me but why did I even do this? Its my damn arm. And to be fair I did though about it way too often in the past but never actually did it, and now for a small inconvenience im acting this weird. I had a shitty  year and awful things happening to me but I always kept myself safe, now I am scared of me.

  
I did reach out for mental health with my gp and tried cbt therapy but advices like ""Go for a walk"" doesn't help me... 

  
sorry I needed to vent somewhere, I cant tell this to nobody. My existence already bothers to others and with this it will just make it even more awkward."
I have issues with clothing,1,0,2025-09-08 18:07:52,"Just a vent. I've been self conscious my whole life about how I dress, I get really obsessed with things like the collar of shirts it has to be exactly right.  Not too loose not overly tight.  I drive myself crazy with it.  The last few years I can no longer stand to wear jeans.  I hate the way they feel, I've resorted to wearing either basketball shorts, or dress pants.  If I could wear basketball shorts and an oversized hooded sweatshirt every single day I'd be happy.  I hate wearing anything that feels tight or uncomfortable.  People get on my case about it, like my wife sometimes, even my boss.  I just wish they knew how unhappy and miserable I am if I don't like what I'm wearing.  I don't know why it's so important to others how you dress.  Its actually gotten worse as I've gotten older."
I need attention,1,2,2025-09-08 18:07:07,"I feel extremely lonely, I have one true friend but he's battling depression and takes hours if not days to reply. My dad comes home late and I almost never see him and he's always exhausted, my mum gets angry at me when I try to talk to her about my life and problems. During one of these periods when I feel very lonely I went as far as telling my friend I had a mental breakdown when I was just lonely just so I could get attention. How do I fix this?

How do I fix my life,1,1,2025-09-08 17:58:44,"How do I structure my life in a way that things just work. How do I stop focusing on shit that doesn't matter and just work.

How do I make a plan and stick to it without fucking dropping everything because I'm miserable, and then regretting it. How do I make a plan towards something I actually want, and not towards some job that would pay the bills but make me miserable, and not towards what someone else wants.

I am truly desperate. I have no idea what to do. I was feeling fine a few days ago, but my own mind is torturing me again. How do I fix this.

Please say something besides therapy. What can I do right now that will benefit my life."
does anyone know the difference between a heart attack and a panic attack?,1,0,2025-09-08 17:56:24,i had a panic attack before but this one's worse i can't exactly put out what's going on. i live alone and the hospital is quite far from here so i don't exactly know what to do. i've tried doing what i searched up on but it doesn't seem to work and i have no one to contact.
Feel hated at work,1,0,2025-09-08 17:50:44,"Hi, so I kinda suffer from overthinking because how I grew up - my sister would always tell me “you should learn how to read people’s mind by their emotion/gesture/the way they talk/etc” and often be like “I already show you hint that I am not pleasant. I said yes instead of yah, can’t you tell the difference in tone? You should really learn how to read tones other wise you will piss people off when you grew older esp at work.”

And now, I’m at work, this actually suffers me. When my manager left me on read for hours, I will feel like my manager hate me because he would take other people’s call even if I messaged him first. Or, in a meeting, my manager will respond other as “yah haha exactly”, but to me is a plain “yes… okay lets move on.” 

This is suffering me and I want to stop overthinking. What are some good tips on overcoming this?"
Encouraging advice in the time of prolonged sadness and loneliness 🦋,2,0,2025-09-08 17:48:34,"I wanted to write this because these are feelings I tried to bury for a long time. 2024 was such a bad year academically, financially and emotionally that I ended up in a psych ward (unaliving attempt) and took a year off from studies to heal and get back on my feet. Last year, i was battling mental issues and  emotional attachments that i am still working on through therapy. Although i am forever greatful that i am seeking help , i dont feel like i am healed enough. I still feel stagnated. I know a lot of people who went through tough times last year but they succeded in getting back on track -new relationships, supportive friend group and etc. While i am still paying a large debt, loss uni friendships, trying to transfer to another uni w poor results, healing from past pain and still clung on a fantasy of being with a person who i know i cant be with. I am just a memory to the people I thought were my people. This is the most vulnerable I have ever been and an advice would be needed 💗

2)I can't help but think of a time where I embrassed myself in front of a man who wasn't interested me and told me that he does not want to talk to me anymore. This happened last year. This is due attachment issues and limerence (which I have been working on through therapy and I have been feeling a bit better than last year). The worst thing I did was compare myself to their partner and it reinforced negative perceptions of myself (such as being uglier). She is more prettier than me (lighter skinned, Skinner and her partner is white) and reinforce negative perceptions of myself being a darker skinned curver woman 

And if I can ask this question in this sub :

How does one form intentional friendshos without being clingy or attached 
So for all my life I have struggled with friendships due to a multitude of factors including childhood trauma, being into the wrong friend groups etc. I grew up being isolated from social interaction and not finding a secure friend group. I am currently in my healing stage and I come to realise that I am the problem. I get get a bit clingy when someone is interested in me and have high expectations on myself and others. I constantly think of how to make others like me which led me to lack boundaries, people pleasing, oversharing etc. I feel bad that I ruined alot of potential friendships.

Update: I found out that I have an abandonment wound and that I  tend to jump into friendships quickly (all thanks to therapy). With all of that said, what I do to fix this.

PLS note that I am still healing from this and I really don't want to be confronted with negativity."
Has online therapy made mental health care more accessible — or just more confusing?,1,0,2025-09-08 17:43:31,"We’ve been thinking a lot about how **online therapy** has changed the way people access care. It’s undeniably made it easier for some, especially those in rural areas or managing tight schedules. But there’s also more choice, more platforms, and sometimes more confusion about what to look for (especially when insurance is involved).

What’s been your experience navigating online therapy — the good, the bad, or the unexpected? Did insurance make it easier or harder?

Would love to hear perspectives from anyone who’s tried online therapy (or is considering it)."

So I picked up an old habit. Just to ruin the image.  
And it worked. Her face changed. The softness disappeared.  
And weirdly… that felt more honest.

She asked if I was still using the breathing thing and I said yeah.  
muum app’s still on my phone. Sometimes I open it just so she believes me.

a guy i got with when i was 16 dated my mom and no one knows,1,2,2025-09-08 17:27:25,"when i was 16 my dad died from a heart attack. he was my favorite person, we were super close, i always looked up to him, so losing him completely broke me. i was always stressed and paranoid about him dying growing up, and then it actually happened. after that i was really isolated, no friends, super alone. one day i was walking through this neighborhood crying and this 40 yr old guy saw me from his porch. he came over, hugged me, comforted me, talked to me, and it calmed me down. he asked my age and for some reason i lied, i said i was 17 turning 18 in 6 months. he said when he saw me he thought i was 18 anyway. we exchanged numbers and he said he wanted to be like a mentor for me, someone there for me.

we texted sometimes, and one night i told him i was gonna sneak out to smoke weed at this park. he said he didn’t want anything to happen to me so he offered to pick me up and bring me to his house to watch a movie instead. i went, we were laying on his bed watching, and i got the urge to kiss him so i did, and then we had sex. after that he kept talking to me, said he wanted to make it exclusive, said after i turned 18 he wanted me to meet his family, even mentioned having kids. i went along with it because even though i knew it was wrong, he gave me the only good feeling in my life at that time.

a couple months later i ended up ghosting him after i got caught sneaking out. a few months after that my mom told me about this guy she was seeing, she showed me pics, and it was him. she had told him who my dad was the first day they started talking, so he definitely knew from early on that i was her daughter, and he still pursued her. they dated, and he even came on a family birthday trip with us acting like nothing had ever happened between us.

what messed me up even more was whenever i got upset, had an attitude, or was cold towards him because of everything, my mom would get annoyed at me and so would he. he’d roll his eyes and say “all teens have attitudes” like i was just being difficult, when really i was drowning in shame and pain because of what happened.

this whole thing destroyed me. i felt so disgusted with myself, ashamed, pathetic, like i was nothing. i already had body image issues and hated myself, and this just confirmed everything bad i believed. like if he could just move on to my own mom and not even care about me, it must mean i’m completely disgusting and unworthy. i feel jealous, rejected, confused, broken. it ruined how i see myself, like i’ll never be good enough for anyone, like no guy would ever actually want me.

i can’t stop thinking about it, i can’t escape it, and it makes me so suicidal. i’m scared i’ll do something to myself that i can’t take back because the feelings are so intense and i don’t know how to handle them. idk what to do"
my brother is aggresive. what to do?,5,3,2025-09-08 17:22:56,"My brother (19) is really aggresive towards my parents and me. Everytime my parents tell him that he can't, for an example take their car because he takes it everyday and it is really pricey, he would start to yell and destroy things around the house. He already broke doors, vases and similar things, dining room chair (he threw it at the floor and broke it). On one instance he even charged at my mom which left us all in shock. His response was ""you made me do it. if you weren't such pain in the fucking ass, I woudn't react this way"". I already have issues with anxiety and panic attacks, but every time it happens it gets me really anxious and I don't know what to do. I told my parents maybe he needs professional help but they always start shouting at me for being too extreme. I don't know what to do, he is really manipulative and aggresive. I told my mum that he will be aggresive towards his wife or kids in the future because he can not control his anger and her response is always ""i don't care. it is her problem if she wants to put up with it"". It effects me mentally, not just me all of us, and I am embarrased because neighbours can hear them fighting every single time because he shouts so loud. Please if someone has any advice, it would be really helpful. Thank you in advance."
Why do I express emotions very weirdly,1,0,2025-09-08 17:16:32,"So, I noticed this recently. When I'm happy, or excited, I speak like usual, and act calm and slow, some people think that I'm bored, and some get offended. Especially if they joke or tell something happy, I don't laugh, or smile, or tell them anything... When I'm relaxed, some people (my relatives or adults that I have to interact with) ask if I'm sad, because my face is sad. I never go out of my own free will to communicate, even if I have to. I don't want to push people away with my way of expressing myself. I have only few friends, and I always feel guilty when they're all happy and interested to talk and hang out, but I'm always stone-faced and look like I don't care, when I do care about them deeply. It’s incredibly difficult for me to put a smile on my face when I'm happy, and change the intonation of my voice, to match the situation's mood, but I have to. And then... My mood literally switches for a day or two. I become lively, funny, chatty and eager to talk (but still won't start the conversation first and come to anyone). As the time passes, I feel ""calm"" again, and don't feel like being energetic ever again. I don't remember about having this as a child, so I don't know the exact age this started at.

Maybe you can give me some tips or advices about being more emotional, or, in general, tell me what it is that I'm experiencing? I don't experience the thoughts of hurting myself or others, and don't feel weird."
how to stop avoiding responsibility when you have anxiety,2,1,2025-09-08 17:14:26,"So I've been in a ""freeze"" like state for the last month. It started with missing single class cause I couldn't complete an assignment and everything kept getting piled up one after the other, and a month went by like that. I feel tingles in my hands every time which only goes away when I sleep. Avoiding and escaping responsibility feel easier than actually facing the current situations, my anxiety goes up every time I hear my phone ring or get notifications so I keep it on DND. It's like I can see my life falling apart right in front of me and there is a button I can press that will stop it from happening, but I am refusing to press it. I know most people would say to just do it and all but, I can't. I am also aware that this is not the right mindset to carry but I was hoping there is someone out here that give me some help and advice on how I can get past this."
I feel like something’s wrong with me,1,2,2025-09-08 17:12:01,"Hi, I’m a 28f. I’ve had a long history with depression and anxiety. I’m currently medicated. 

For all intents and purposes, things have been going pretty good lately. I got a nice new studio apartment, and an extremely chill job that lets me afford it. Money is a little tight but it’s doable.  I have these things, with friends and family who care and love me. So…why am I still unhappy? 

I woke up this morning for work and wasn’t able to get out of bed. It’s after 1pm and I still haven’t gotten up. I feel so bad when I get like this, like why can’t I just be tougher? These days happen more than I’d like to admit, at least once a month, if not more. It’s gotten me in a little bit of trouble at work, and at this point I’m just not sure what to do. I don’t understand why I can be in such a good place and still feel this way. 

I don’t want to sound ungrateful. I really am grateful for these wonderful privileges I have, but that makes these feelings all the more confusing. 

I guess this is more of a vent, but if anyone has any thoughts or advice on your experiences and how you got through something like this, I would really appreciate it."
When will I be enough?,6,1,2025-09-08 17:04:46,"I feel sorta vulnerable posting this but I can't hold this in any longer. Why am I never enough for anyone to genuinely love me? I give myself fully to people I care about. My friendships/relationships are never transactional. Im a good person, even when no one is around. I wish the best for everyone. I dont have a lot but would still give the clothes off my body to those who need help. I listen and enjoy comforting the ones around me. I never ask for anything in return but I can't help but to feel completely alone, at the end of the day. I cant seem to understand why I am not good enough to be loved and cherished. The same way I'm so willing to love and cherish people I care about. Or people in general, even if I dont know you. When is it going to be my turn to recieve the love i give so effortlessly? I dont expect pity or for anyone to really understand how I'm feeling. Just needed to get this of my chest before I implode. Just need someone, anyone, to hear my pain."
I have an extremely short temper but...,2,1,2025-09-08 16:49:11,"I have an extremely short temper but I manage it very well so it gets dismissed as a problem. 
God is it ever exhausting.
I obviously can't remove an emotion, but maybe some people can share ways to at least lighten the blow because I literally go from zero to nuclear in an instant. 
People never really know because I managed to keep it to myself and under control consistently. However, it takes every ounce of energy in my being to maintain that composure and I just wish I knew why I have such a strong, negative emotion in the first place. 

Most people don't believe I have an anger issue because it's never seen, but those who do believe me often make suggestions like finding a healthy outlet- which is fair, but most healthy outlets either haven't worked for me or aren't a viable or reasonable option for myself.

Some context of who I am- a very hard-working individual, upwards of 60 hours a week. I have a 7-month-old at home but these concerns came to light long before he was born. I come from a long line of family in poor financial status and in poor mental health, things like anxiety and depression disorders as well as even  psychosis and BPD are often relatively common in my bloodline. I have always had trouble sleeping relevant to my diagnoses, my eating habits are also poor also commonly relevant to my diagnoses, I try to make time for hobbies but I have difficulty finding passion, time and energy.

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression disorders when I was younger and I learned a lot of CBT and DBT to help keep things maintained, and I'm not a fan of medicating I tried that for my anxiety and it was either completely useless or made things worse.

At this point I just feel like I'm at complete loss because there are no true resources for a solution to reducing strong emotion, only resources to managing them. But at this point managing is not enough, I am seriously at a breaking point where one of these days it is going to boil over and I may finally lash out on these emotions."

I want to rip my fucking face off,16,11,2025-09-08 16:37:22,"I hate my face, I  hate my smile, me eyes. the urge to do something about it intense"
Struggling to Stay Afloat,1,0,2025-09-08 16:37:03,"I’m really struggling to keep going. At the beginning of the year, I took time off work to focus on my mental health. I got on the right meds, and things started to look up. I returned to work after 3 months. Things were going okay, until I realized that my meds were affecting my lifestyle. I developed blurry vision, and couldn’t focus on my work. I picked up reading as a hobby to decompress, but eventually I couldn’t read. I had to adjust my meds, and now I feel like I’ve lost progress. 

I’m struggling even more at work, and on top of that I’ve found myself drowning in credit card debt. After taking 3 months off, with little savings, I lost 10K. And I’m still trying to recover from that.

I feel like I wasted time and money, only to end up in the same place I was a year ago. I’m losing hope, and I just want to know that everything is going to be okay. 

It’s probably going to be another year before I finally get back on my feet. I’m just really struggling to make sense of it all. I just feel like I made a series of poor decisions. And I hate that I have to even deal with my mental health. I’m just frustrated with my progress. I just want to be okay. 

Can anyone relate?"
I still feel lonely while surrounded by people,7,3,2025-09-08 16:32:54,"I feel like I have no real close friends, I act cheerful and am part of big friend groups but I still feel like im so alone. I had a conversation with my friend today and it made me realise that I rarely ever talk about myself, its y birthday soon but I don't even know who I would invite, I don't just wanna be alone, I feel like im alone. All my friends are so close to each other, they do sports together and they talk about shows I don't watch and things I don't do, they plan hangouts im not invited to and they wear matching costumes for halloween, I know they like me, but I don't feel like they do. maybe its because they think im weird, I kind of am, Im probably neurodivergent but I don't like thinking too hard about it. I feel like there's some core part of being a teenage girl that I don't understand, I don't wanna miss out but I don't even know what I would be missing out on. I feel like I don't understand my peers. I wish high school was over. I want to go to college so badly and meet people who I can actually understand. maybe I just feel this way because im a dramatic teenage girl but still, I don't even do anything interesting, the only thing im good at is writing fiction. I feel like the people I talk to know nothing about me. I feel like im growing apart from them. I hate being a teenager, I feel like im being cheated out of a core experience."
"I want to improve the quality of my life, but it seems impossible to me.",1,2,2025-09-08 16:32:50,"Hello everyone. I've had anxiety, pessimism, and OCD for a very long time. They've always been with me, I don't even know if they're a part of me. But recently I felt a sense of well-being and this wonderful feeling when nothing bothered me, all my problems seemed solved, I saw a way that suits me to solve some problems, life in general felt better. But it was temporary, after a bit of time I got into my ""default"" state with all my problems, and mys suffering from it.

I have to deal with anxiety, overthinking all the time. I tried to unfriend with online people I played, but they called me a traitor and I feel guilty for unfriending them. Yet, I still have one online friend that I want to unfriend with, and I feel like a piece of trash for wanting so, but I cant help it. Also in this year realized how miserable I am with my addictions, and that made me hate myself even more. I want to be forgotten by a lot of people. I feel like im already tired of life. Soon is my birthday, but I honestly dont want people to know, to bring attention to me any longer. I can even go to therapist or so because of my age. + I dont want to worry my parents and family about myself. I realized how much time I lost onto internet and not real life, regretting wasting half of my life. I dont know how to deal with my problems and I feel like I want to live less and less. I have a bad mood all the time practically for few months. 

  
Short: Got stressed a lot in one year, now tired of life and everything."
"I imagine fantasies in my head to the point where I get lost in them in my daily life, I need help?",1,2,2025-09-08 16:25:05,"Title, for the past three years I have been consistently making up stories up in my head to the point where it’s all I can think about within my daily life. It is heavily dependent on music and how I’m feeling while listening to it. For example, while listening to something dramatic or orchestral I get lost in imagining a climactic fight scene where I physically start trying to act it out. Or if it’s something sad I imagine a character death or something tragic happening to the point where I start saying actual dialogue as if I was in a movie or something. 

The people in these fantasies are people that I know in my real, day to day life. Even people that I don’t talk to anymore I get a grasp of their personality and store them in my mind as an archetype or something. Of course I would never  tell them about any of this but it’s fucking weird and strange. 

My own role is that of a main character or something I don’t know. I recognise that none of it is real and it’s all just make believe but it feels so good to just escape to this world I’ve made up in my head. I don’t have to worry about real life responsibilities or anything, and it’s always in tune with the music that I listen to. I love it so much but it’s taking a toll on my actual life I spend more then 6 hours a day dissociating and lost within my own head just imagining all this. It’s a problem because I’m forgetting to do actual tasks in terms of my career and whatnot, I forget to talk to people or my family. Friends are concerned about me. But at the same time it’s so hard to just let go of it, the real world fucking sucks, and these fantasies are always playing in my head anyways.

What do I do? How do I just tune it all out and focus on the real, necessary stuff. I’m genuinely concerned with how much of my day to day it’s taking up, do I talk to a therapist?"

Warning: Su!c!de thoughts mentioned
Alright, i just made a reddit account to post this.
I'm 18F, and yes, i am from india...
That india that everyone seems to hate so much...
I have had depression for 3 years, but despite everything, the treatment, pills, ""life style"" changes, it hasnt gotten much better. But now in these months, it has gotten worse... 
I always wanted to settle in New Zealand because of how inclusive and friendly the people there seemed to be, but now from all of these protests, i'm scared that my dreams are gonna shatter.
I want to be an Aged-Care Nurse there incase your wondering and i cant do that in india because of some personal criteria and because i just dont want to be in this ridiculous country.
First it was this, and the main part, is the social media hate. It hasnt increased tenfold, no its turned into a full on hate rascist campaign against us for a few morons who can't understand civic sense. And now recently for the past few days, i've been getting su!c!de ideas and thoughts because i just feel so hopeless and lost about what to do. My own countrymen and classmates never wanted to be friends with me and i was bullied alot, but now i know that not even the sweetest community can accept me because of where i was born.
I hate my countrymen and people, and i hate those idiotic social media comments ruining the crumbs of our reputation because of their inadequacy and insensitivity, this is what our country is, a hollow, hatred beam of insensitivity and carelessness. I feel so worthless that i am born in this country and look like an ""indian"". 

I am mainly asking for advice on what to do to perhaps distract my thoughts or atleast try to speak up about this to my parents, but i know no one will listen and i'll be hated in the opposite because i'm somehow ""racist"" and ""anti nationalist"" while its all of those guys spewing idiotic social media comments like ""We will take over"" or ""Canada will become the Next india.""

TLDR; Started having su!c!de thoughts because of all the indian hate, indians being practically dehumanized in social media and the protests and comments everywhere against migration as someone who wants to be a Aged-care nurse in New Zealand and now feels hopeless about future, career or even any chance of living past this month. Also, i have never gotten with anyone, have gotten bullied and harassed by indians so much that i am traumatized just by stepping outside or seeing relatives. I feel like reddit is my last hope for any help or advice to hope for my future and atleast try to share this with my stubborn parents."
My brain feels so foggy and dense i need help please read,2,1,2025-09-08 15:58:51,"My brain always feels like its being pressurized from every angle. Its been like this for years now. My head hurts all the time. It feels blocked. I cant remember anything from the past. The memories i can remember are blurry. Its immensely affecting my studies. I used to be really good at understanding and memorizing my studies and i was always a great student. But now i dont understand basic topics, forget basic formulas and math etc. I cant even speak properly or think clearly. I procrasinate so much that i dont even study for exams now. I passed by copying my friends and cheating. But now i changed cities and schools so i dont have anyone and i have to get into the top school in the city so i can go to a good college. I really need to get in but in my current mental state i cant do anything. I cant even get out of bed. Going to school is excruciating. My mother is always verbally abusing me, degrading and insulting me and hitting me. It was always like this from when i was a child. My father is also a horrible person and did shitty things to us so we dont live with him anymore. I have old friends whom i enjoy talking with but for some reason i could never form genuine connections with anyone. Everything felt so fake. The problem was me. I always had this cold feeling swallowing me from inside my chest and I dont understand why this is happening. I cant even process anything. I dont understand the difference between right or wrong. Everything feels unreal. I feel like im not inside my body or mind. Life doesnt feel real. Nothing feels alive. I have these periods where i dont feel any emotions at all for months and months and i dont feel like im a human. I felt no sadness and no happiness.

Been suffering silently from OCD since I was 14.,1,1,2025-09-08 15:58:09,"Im a 31 year old male. I have been having obsessions since I was 14. I know many people think of OCD as someone who likes to count or wash their hands alot but that hasnt been me. The obsessions I experience can be extremely disturbing and frightening. The thoughts are of a violent and sexual nature. Not so much that I want to do these things but that its possible I could do them and it plays like a movie in my head.

 It started at 14 when I was driving with my stepdad and I got a thought that I could grab the steering wheel while he was driving and run us off the road. When I was 17 I had my first real bad obsessions like I thought I was going to catch a severe incurable medical condition and that I was going to die like mad cow disease and rabies.

 So I would google them and read about them and then to feel better I would delete my browser history and all my tabs. I played this video game called fallout 3 when I was 17 and there are cartoonish and graphic depictions of violence. So I thought I could do something like that and I had bizarre  intrusive thoughts about hurting my family and animals. I figured the only way to get it to stop was to completely remove the game from the house and stop myself from having access to it. So I grabbed the disc and I broke it in half and threw it in the trash. These thoughts caused me to have a panic attack. I have not played fallout again and I wont.

This seemed to be a recurrent theme with certain video games like the last of us 2 and cyberpunk 2077. So I would play the game and then I would delete it from my steam library which caused the thoughts to go away.

I also will have intrusive thoughts about actually being a homosexual even though I have always considered myself to be heterosexual and only desire intimate relationships with women. Again this isnt a ""thought"" its like a movie that plays in my head and terrifies me. So to deal with this i try to avoid being around young men.  

This condition has been something ive dealt with for a long time and it can be absolutely debilitating. I am starting the process of getting the help I need. I was always afraid to tell my family for obvious reasons"
I want to be mute,1,2,2025-09-08 15:53:08,"I want to become a selective mute. 

I know it's for one reason or another and it's all psychological but I seriously cannot stand the fact that everything I say is misconstrued or blatantly ignored. I don't want to talk, I don't want to use my voice, I'd rather not have one tbh. 

I've always wanted to learn ASL and maybe that will help with construing what I mean, or text. Emojis help others show I'm not intending to being rude. I struggle heavily with emotional dysregulation and need to get to a psychiatrist ASAP but that's been on the back burner out of fear.

I am exhausted and at rock bottom in my life but that's another story. I just fail whenever I speak, I can't articulate exactly what I mean, and even if I do, it's hours worth of arguing or explaining exactly what I meant or what I need and the people around me just disregard it anyway. 

Has anyone gone selectively mute? How did you transition and communicate? 😞"

All I can think about is what if he wasn’t born September 8th all  those years ago? What if he just never existed ?? Would I have got hurt?? What if ? 
I can still visualize his features, that golden blond hair, I can clearly visualize and see his smile, I can still hear that heavy breathing at times, those bright blue piercing eyes starring me down.

I know this shit is just in my brain, only in my head, but i can't handle it, one day i'll completely lose my footing with reality and confund reality & illness. I'm know i'm going crazy, i've talked about schizophrenia with my psychiatrist, the only issue is that if i'm diagnozed with schizophrenia i would not ever be able to take my oestrogens and not be able to do my gender transition. It's a law in my country



Sorry if my english is not perfect, it's not my native language, i've tried my best

  
Just writing this post helps me a bit, and also the medication is doing its job, i'm just scared because psychosis crisis are more present in my life week after week. I do not want to end my life in a psychiatrist hospital."

Resign to move in with parents and start new job,1,5,2025-09-08 15:24:40,Almost 40 years old and considering this. Thoughts? Reason primarily related to mental health and isolation.
Some people are unbelievable,10,8,2025-09-08 15:19:17,I once made a post about r@pe. Im a csa victim. At first he ask about How's uni because he stumble upon my uni result post first then the other post. What make me flabbergasted is that he then proceed.. into asking am i chill with nsfw stuff and fling? 1 question. What make you think i am?? Especially with what happened to me. Some people istg. I may lacked of love and in pain. But im not a fool.
I feel like I don’t fit in at all and it’s starting to affect me,1,4,2025-09-08 15:05:48,"Hi, I just need to let this out. I’m a first-year student from addu and ever since classes started, I feel like I don’t fit in with my section. Everyone seems to already have their groups, their friends, and their people to rely on… and then there’s me.

I feel invisible. I try to blend in, but instead I just end up overthinking everything. It’s made me really self-conscious. I want to ask for help with academics sometimes, but I can’t bring myself to approach anyone. I’m socially awkward and naturally conservative I prefer to be alone, but in school, there are tasks that really require socializing since my course is more on business. That’s where I get stuck.

I don’t have friends. From what I see, I’m the only one who’s always alone, and it makes me feel so lonely and left out. Since most of them graduated from the same shs and already have their groups. What makes it worse is that my academics have taken a toll, too. Back in high school, I was a consistent honor student. Now, it feels like I’m losing myself because of all these struggles.

For me, I feel like this is not that big of a problem. But this really affected me so badly somehow, to the point i inflicted cuts on my wrist. I tried counseling once and the counselor gave me advices but I cant really seem to apply them because i get so anxious. I tried to ask help from my parents they just told me to be strong.

I really want to improve, i’m finding ways to mitigate the stress I am on. I understand that i’m still adjusting but it just took a large toll on me. Not only I’m bothered with the fact that i don’t have friends I’m also away from home.

I want to improve, I want to reach out, but I just don’t know how to start without making things more awkward. So this is why i’m making this reddit post to ask advices from different opinions on here. Has anyone else been through this? How do you push yourself to break out of this cycle of loneliness and fear of talking to people? How do I end this painful cycle of anxiety and self consciousness?"
How do you trust your therapist/ therapy?,1,1,2025-09-08 15:04:07,"So, I really like my therapist. But I have this lingering thought…

There are deeply harmful systemic issues that continue to disparage marginalized people, including myself directly. As long as those issues are still at play, a lot of people, *including (edited: did not mean to type excluding) myself, will continue to be exploited for profit and forced into poverty. Like… how do I not feel like my therapist is essentially “prepping cattle for slaughter”, working with people enough to help them function in a society that directly hurt them in the first place and continues to use them? I get she’s not the biggest issue (as she is not the only therapist on the planet) and I like to think she wouldn’t cause harm on purpose, but what am I missing so I don’t view her as harming me and other people impacted as I am?"
Mental health vs job,1,0,2025-09-08 14:58:48,"I am a 22 year old male living in Pune, India. I work in an MNC. This job is really really taking a big toll on my mental health. Fell like immediately living this job. My family is supportive of this decision but still i am hesitant. I am dealing with trauma as well as poor defence mechanisms. Taking therapy also but I dont see a way out other than leaving this job. Drop down your comments if you feel this way too. We can exchange thoughts."
Idk what to do anymore,1,2,2025-09-08 14:53:11,"Hey, I’m 16m and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if I’m depressed or if I’m just in a stage in my life, but I feel like shit all day, every day. I feel hopeless for my future, like nothing is going to change. I don’t wanna do anything anymore — even trying feels wrong now. The only good part of my day is sleeping, it’s so much more peaceful than being awake.

I was probably the happiest I had ever been this time 1 year ago. It’s when I got my first girlfriend. We broke up last June and she became very distant from me. I don’t blame her though — I was a shitty boyfriend to her at times. I cared for her and I was good sometimes, I done some selfish things though that make me feel really guilty. I miss her a lot and I’m stuck in a loop of waiting for her, even though I know she probably won’t come back.

I had issues before I got with her, just with feeling lonely and shitty, but after we broke up the issues came back — but like 10x worse. It made me realise how much she meant to me and how valuable she was.

I don’t really go out with my friends. We usually hang out in school and that’s it. Any plans we try to make outside of school never happen. My mental health has gotten very bad, to the point where it feels dangerous now. I’ve hurt myself and had those thoughts many times, and I just feel empty and lost every day — like no matter what I do, this won’t end.

That, along with missing my ex and seeing her almost every day in school, is horrible. I don’t think I’m a good person. I’ve done some really shitty things I feel really guilty about, and I just wanna be a better person, but I don’t think I can be one.

I wanna be happy and not rely on someone else to make me happy. I don’t wanna be miserable anymore.

I hope this all made sense — sorry if it didn’t, just thought I’d come on Reddit and put this out here. Might help, idk. Thanks."
I wish it was me,1,1,2025-09-08 14:53:00,"My younger brother recently tore his ACL and not long before that broke his arm. I know he hates it and it’s really bothering him especially cause it’s his last year and he plays football. I just don’t understand why the world hits someone like him and not me who’s useless and can’t do anything right. I mean my body is literally worthless so why can’t I take the this from him and onto myself. I ask myself sometimes why I couldn’t take my grandads pancreatic cancer and maybe things would have been better with him around instead of me plus I’d finally be at peace. My grandma recently had a black spot found in your chest but why her and not me. People getting hurt and sick around me yet I’m still here and I don’t even want to be here. 

I mean I’d be more use to people in death than I ever was in life anyhow. I’m a sorry excuse for a person and I just wish I could trade myself or my body for someone else. I’ve always wanted to dedicate myself to helping people and maybe this could be my way, sacrificing myself cause it’s nothing left anyway. I probably sound crazy but it’s just bothering me why I’m still here or why I’m fine and intact but the people I love have to deal with the unfairness of the world but a suicidal bastard like me lives on or doesn’t get hurt. It’s not fair when bad people like me still walk around fine but good people die or have their lives potentially flipped upside down and I don’t understand. I’d let the world tear me limb from limb if it meant knowing it was me and not somebody else suffering or maybe I’m just so numb I don’t care anymore."
Feel like my life is falling apart,1,1,2025-09-08 14:52:01,"Me and my gf moved to a small village last January after living in our small 32sqm studio for the last 12 years. 

Since January my gf had two periods where because of the move, our new neighbours and her studies she has fallen into a depressive state and considered self harm as her only way out. We have been looking for professional help but it is hard to get in the village we are in. 

Last wensday was a new flare up because after 3 months of fostering a rescue dog we finally found somebody who is willing to give our foster her forever home. This has caused some tension because on the one hand we are really happy that somebody is willing to take her in. This will give my gf the room she needs to heal. (Every bark, lick etc. became to much because she was constantlu on edge after both our neighborhoors started leaving passive agressieve notes) on the other hand we were considering ending this foster period in adopting her ourselves. After she called me about her last critical period (crying , wanting to harm herself and wanting to sleep) something snapped.

I feel tired, angry and sad at the same time. Can barely focus at work and feel like i am stuck. For the last 2,5 years i heard promises that she would finish her studies (kept postponning her deadline), she would look for professional help (finally some progress now) and promised she would do everyone for us to move back to our old city. 

In the meantime i have made a appointment with a shrink and my gp because i know it is not her fault. I just feel hopeless, with the rising prices of houses i feel like i will never be able to move back to the place wich i called home. Never will be able to have a dog (sounds are becoming to much) or children for that matter. (Even tough when have talked about this for the last 13 years). 

Sorry if my post isnt very coherent. I find it difficult to write down what i am feeling at the moment."
Weird dreams and intrusive thoughts,1,4,2025-09-08 14:49:56,I keep having these thoughts of cheating on my partner. I don’t want too and I love him deeply I just don’t understand why I keep having these thoughts and dreams. I love him to the ends of the earth and I feel disgusting even having these thoughts. Like I’m not worthy of love if I keep having these thoughts. What’s wrong with me. :(
Weird way I got rid of schizo OCD,1,1,2025-09-08 14:47:16,"Back in 2020, I was preparing for JEE (an engineering entrance exam in India).
So I have always had a curious mind and once in my study breaks, I stumbled across the term 'schizophrenia'. Naturally I started researching about it like, causes, symptoms, everything. I read somewhere that it starts around age 25, and that freaked me out. After few days of researching about it, I started to develop an irrational fear of ""what if I get this disease"", I started exercising too much cause I read exercise reduces the risk of developing it, stopped myself from getting sad and all those stuff. 

I started questioning my sanity which spiraled into panic attacks, I use to run around here and there.
I began experiencing random ""mind pops"", images, words, and sentences that made no sense. I also developed a compulsion of shaking my head left and right whenever I use to get these  thoughts. This continued for a month or two. My life became hell in this period.

Then out of a blue, I came across a yt video of a guy interviewing a really pretty girl. I got completely infatuated with her, found her on ig, and stalked her everyday, and got totally wrapped up in this obsession. Surprisingly, as I started stalking her online, I completely forgot about my intrusive thoughts and OCD symptoms.

Since then, I haven't had those symptoms return which feels strange. I saw on quora that OCD is lifelong, so I am left wondering what happened to me during that phase. Is this relatable to anyone?
Does anyone have any explanation on what happened to me? I also feel how silly my previous worries were.

This all happened 4 years ago. Today I got the curiosity to know what happened to me at that time. 

My ocd symptoms are no more, but now I have developed this strange habit of checking her Insta page every single day, there hasn't been a day in last four years where I haven't stalked her."
Do you ever feel attached to your mental health struggles? What would your life look like if you fully healed?,1,1,2025-09-08 14:46:24,"This might sound strange, but I’ve been thinking a lot about my relationship with my own mental health struggles. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety since 2014, which is over a decade now. It feels like such a significant part of my life and identity that I honestly don’t know who I’d be without it.

For as long as I can remember, I’ve described myself as “someone with mental health issues.” It’s been a big part of how I relate to others and how I see myself. And if I’m being completely honest, I’ve sometimes used it as a way to communicate my emotional limits in relationships or arguments — like saying, “I’m already struggling with my mental health, don’t add more to my plate.” I don’t mean it manipulatively, but it’s been my reality for so long that it feels like part of my personality.

Now that I’m actively trying to heal, I keep wondering:
	•	What will my life look like if I do get better?
	•	Who will I be if I’m not “the person with anxiety and depression” anymore?
	•	Will I feel lost without this part of me, like I’m having an identity crisis?

I’m starting to realize I might even have an anxious attachment to my own mental health struggles. As much as I want to heal, I’m also scared of letting go of the only version of myself I’ve known for so long.

Has anyone else ever felt this way? Like your mental health challenges are so deeply woven into who you are that you’re hesitant to imagine life without them?"

Feeling empty and thinking of SH,1,1,2025-09-08 14:42:07,"So i (15M) have my first year of highschool and and im feeling nothing and feeling empty. I had these feelings since the summer holidays, but then i thought that it was just because i had no schedule and that it would go away, but it didnt. Also i easily get red in the face, so people make fun of me for it and im very insecure about it. I hate myself for my big weight (im not weight, just a bit overweight, but i still hate how i look) and how i look overall. Im not sure if i can tell my mom, because when i tried to in the past, she just told me ""Oh but you dont need therapy, some people have it way worse."" I did SH ""only"" once in the past, but that feeling is coming back. Im taking my anti anxiety pills almost all the time. I just dont know what to do."
I wish my curiousity was greater than my fears,1,1,2025-09-08 14:32:41,"I am curious and i want to learn and be taught new skills. But even trying something on my own while others are around, clearly minding their own business makes my heart race. It could be the simplest thing that would make me sweat Sometimes even alone i cant focus because i feel watched.


This holds me back, i cant go to the gym, i cant learn in public and i cant dare to try. Anything.


How do i fix this? I want to be the best version of myself but i lack passion. I gave up on life a long time ago, so i dont except much. But maybe its worth a try."

Getting Harassed at the bus is makeing me think about self harming,1,1,2025-09-08 14:24:27,I have to go to school with a public bus full of my old classmates. The harassment was way worse 2 years ago but I thought they'd eventually get the memo that I dont want to have anything to do with them. 2 years of ignoring them later they still do the same. Everyone else got the memo but these 2 just cant stop. I really just want feal safe going with the fucking bus. I cant handled fealing like this every day. I really just want them to leave me alone.

Issues with Rich parents,1,1,2025-09-08 14:18:36,"So I am a 21 year old girl. My dad is having a business.

My parents are extremely people pleasers and mom gives money to their sisters and parents like anything. I was never allowed to go out with any of friends and my has anxiety issues we never went outside or home town cause my mom is too tired for anything. I am a topper of class and extremely good in academics. I am helping my dad in his business since the age of 15. I always undervalued and started people pleasing by looking at my parents. But I learnt my lesson and realised that i should not repeat my parents mistakes. forget about shorts and bodycon dresses I am not even allowed to pair a legging with a kurti. I all the time wear oversized shirts and stuff I have no friends and I barely talk withy parents. My parents are sad with the fact that I drink coffee and tea. I told them multiple times that please allow me for tea and coffee and even though they also know that people my age are drinking alcohol and smoking I am just asking for coffee. I am just an average looking girl and I am not even allowed to keep my what's app profile of my picture,l. I don't have any social media account. I feel too out dated bit looking at the positive side I have hands on experience of doing business. But they still point out all my mistakes"
Day dreaming a lot,1,1,2025-09-08 14:13:38,"17f. I day dream a lot I mean a lot. I've done it since I was 9, 8 years. I keep imagining myself with a better life and a better life. Not saying I have a bad life or anything but a better one. I keep thinking myself winning awards, having achievements and been recognised. Having better quality friendships. Having success businesses, having money and moving out. I feel like it has gotten in the way of my life a lot. I really do feel like a lot of my youth is wasted, those I can't ever get back. I feel so trapped stuck in a cycle."
I have no reason to live. It's really boring,7,5,2025-09-08 14:12:07,"So boring it hurts. I’m still in high school and I'm studying and I’m studying reaaaally hard, I turn in all my work and i work so hard my brain feels like it's gonna explode but the thing is i don't even know why. 😅 
When you get a job it's because you need the money to afford the food you need to keep on living and when you're living you do the things that make you happy, and i have none of that. 
I feel like I’m too stupid for society. If I'm on my own I can function just fine but when it's time for anything that remotely involves socializing I’m reminded of just how dumb I actually am. I tell people my dream job which is literally just something i think i could stand doing for a living without going completely insane, and they'd look at me as if I'm the most clueless little thing they've ever seen. They tell me I’m not ready for the real world because I still wanna pursue something that definitely won't get me far. And it feels very degrading because my 14 year old self would've just let herself rot away in her room and not do anything at all (except. y’know. have a staring contest with a razor blade). I'm doing something.. And before my peers started shaming me for having something i could call a dream, i felt like i was actually in control of my life.

Maybe I am naive, but maybe I just lack so much genuine social interaction that i never realized how pitiful I probably am to most people. I feel really sad. I feel like everyone's nice to everyone but me. I feel like i dont deserve to have an opinion, I don't deserve to make decisions, and i don't get to breathe the same air as everyone, and that's just how it's supposed to be.

I’m bored. I'm sad. And I'm tired of feeling anything. I want to end it. But something's holding me back and I don't know what. Tonight I'm sitting on my bed and like any other night i asked myself if i wanted to keep going, and my mind says ‘no.’ Usually there'd be a sign of hesitation, like, ‘I’m scared. I don't want it to hurt.’ or ‘I don’t want to go to hell.’ or ‘How am I even going to do it?’ But right now my minds empty and it's ready to become permanently empty. It needs to end and I don't care what happens tomorrow and any following day. Maybe I’m just so exhausted I can’t even get up and kick the damn chair. I hope someday I’d regain my strength and actually find the courage to do it. 

So uh. I find peace in the fact that I'm not scared anymore. I literally don't feel anything anymore, really. One tiny inconvenience would probably be it. I’m gone. Also idk why I'm posting this on an app I almost never open, but i really needed to get it all out -- buhbye!!!!!"
Idea for a digital tool for self-reflection - looking for feedback,1,1,2025-09-08 14:02:40,"Hi everyone,

I hope this post is okay here. I'm not promoting anything, I just have an idea and I really value the perspectives in this community.

I've been thinking a lot about tools for self-growth and managing day-to-day stress and negative thought patterns. While therapy is amazing, it's not always accessible. Journaling is great, but it can be hard to know what to write or how to identify your own patterns.

I'm playing with an idea for a guided, private digital journal that's designed to help you connect the dots over time.

The core idea is that it would:

Help you structure your thoughts through prompts and exercises (like CBT-based ones).

Track your moods and triggers over time to visually show you patterns you might miss. (e.g., ""Hey, you've felt really down every Sunday for a month. What's up with that?"")

Feel like a supportive, non-judgmental space that remembers your past entries to help you see your own progress.

My main questions for you all are:

Does the concept of a more guided, insightful journaling tool sound helpful to you?

What would be your biggest concerns about using something like this? (e.g., privacy, feeling too impersonal, etc.)

If it was built with input from mental health professionals, is this something you might find useful as a supplement to other coping techniques?

Again, this is just an idea stage. I'm not a professional, just someone trying to see if there's a better way to help people help themselves. All honest feedback is welcome and appreciated.

Thanks for your time."
"Obsession with failure, shame, and negative thoughts?",1,0,2025-09-08 13:51:45,"Back story: 
- 24M, 25 in less than a month.
- Been working full time for 3 years, business analyst.
- Finishing up my second BS degree in computer science in December. 
- Single, no real urge to be in a relationship. 
- Live at home, single parent house hold, help pay bills, maintain the house, fork in for mortgage, & pay my own tuition. 
- Diagnosed ADHD PI with OCD, prescribed medication. 

Everything I do appears to be worthless and a failure in the end. Genuinely every self reflection is negative in some sense, I cannot get past these thoughts of negativity. I can’t even recall something positive, because nothing I have done feels positive. 

First degree, worthless, second degree and I have thoughts it’s worthlessness, even though I’m working as a business analyst. Doesn’t matter, seemed to be a waste.

My career feels like a job, I don’t see myself working here for the rest of my life, just seems like a way to pay the bills. And this thought feels extremely 
negative. 

I invest routinely in my Roth IRA have a decent amount in there, and have a good amount saved up, this sounds good but does not feel it.

I work out 6 days a week, running and lifting both. I know I am in good shape. But I do not feel it. 

On paper I’m and doing pretty good at this life thing but I do not feel it. I don’t feel depressed, I don’t feel anxious, i don’t feel happy, I don’t feel sad. 

I just feel I am obsessed with my failures. I feel everyone can see every failure I’ve had and every shameful act I have done. I feel inferior to every single person, to the point I have physical symptoms of humiliation with facial flushing and hot flashes (typically only happens when I am off my medication). 

I thankfully have an extremely strong sense of self discipline, that has powered my life for approximately that last 7-8 years. 

I am not ideating at all, rather just annoyed with this feeling. I don’t even know if it is a feeling, rather just an obsessive thought that will not leave. 

Anyone else share this? Anyone else get rid of this? 

Edit: 
There is so much I am leaving out of this, used to be over weight, addicted to nicotine, addicted to tobacco, heavy drinker, smoked weed. All of that has been corrected. Still feels negative. 

I have hobbies, I once again regularly partake in, but that’s temporary joy and gone within a few hours. 

Watching TV feels like a criminal offense, watching a YouTube short feels like I am committing a felony. To the point I have cut my screen time down to approximately 3 hours a day. 

What is going on. Turned into rant sorry."
Just a quick vent,2,1,2025-09-08 13:42:15,"Never posted here before, I have commented in a few subs but never posted, so I am a qualified chef and I have been working with racehorses for most of my life, suffering with depression and anxiety since I was 18, pills don't work they make me suicidal, therapy doesn't work they want you to go through everything that makes you depressed in the first place and makes you feel a million times worse, so I have recently had an opportunity to get out of racing as I am away a lot with work and spend too much time away from my family I have a partner and 4 children one is 2 years old so as I was saying I had an opportunity to rent a food trailer local to my family I have spent a lot of time renovating it from an absolutely dreadful state to being a clean and modern breakfast trailer the problem is it has taken its toll on me, it's drained my money, it's taken the time that I thought I was getting back with my family from me and I have been open 3 months and am still yet to take a profit from it, it has sent me back into a hole of not wanting to be there or in fact I don't even want to leave the house, obviously I know depression will never leave me but sometimes I have a few months where I'm doing brilliant and then things all pile up on me and then I'm back to square one I hate it, I hate my partner seeing this and I feel like I'm always letting my family down, constantly, this is the second time I've tried to open my own business and it hasn't gone to plan, today I can't even afford to stick it as we had an absolutely terrible week last week hardly breaking £30 a day and that just covers the bare minimum, I have had the landlord give me a rent free period but now that has ended and he wants the rent so I've spent all this money on getting it up to scratch had a couple of good weeks where I've been able to invest back into the business but other than that it just costs more and more and now I have nothing left to give and it's burning me inside sorry if it's long winded but I just need to get it out to people who don't know me, not for sympathy because I would get that from those closest to me I just need some support I feel like I'm down in a hole that I can't get out of, and just to add this has gone from jobs that pay really well, sometimes over £3000 a month to not even earning a penny but doing ten times the work, thanks"
I read some really gross fanfic as a teen and genuinely see absolutely zero reason I deserve to live.,9,31,2025-09-08 13:36:13,"From the ages of 13 to 16 I read a myriad of things on ao3 that were about incredibly violent, taboo, and terrible things. This went from abuse to gross, harmful kinks. I want to note I never ""got off"" to any of stuff, and I don't think/really hope none of it aroused me. 

I'm not going to get into the specifics both because it might be triggering and to comply with this subs rules. Recently I have been wondering if the very act of reading that kind of thing makes me a bad person. If it was a bad thing to do. I had never been through any of the stuff I read about, thankfully. I enjoyed reading about this kind of thing and sought it out pretty consistently. It wasn't an accident nor was it done purely out of curiosity, although that was an aspect. I never thought any of this stuff was alright in real life. I never posted or shared anything I read. 

The thing that gets me, and what I'm genuinely considering ending my life over is this. TW: mentions of fictional underage sex. During this time I read explicit scenes about people my age and older. I don't want to say I haven't read anything about people younger because I read so much and a lot of it had heavy themes of csa. I do know that I refused to read anything where that wasn't portrayed as wrong. Although not everything handled in a way I'd agree with now. Now I've recently seen people online compare reading anything involving underage sex as comparable csam. It doesn't fit the legal definitions of it, nor is it punishable. But it being legal and it being right are two very different things. 

Did I do something wrong? 

Is this forgivable?"
"21M - I feel like I’m living a double life, and I’m losing myself in both",1,7,2025-09-08 13:31:14,"I don’t know how to say this perfectly, but I need to get it out. I’m 21, male, and I’ve been struggling with depression for a while. I was on medication for some time, but it was discontinued by my doctors. Since then, things have spiraled.

I feel like I’m living two lives—one at home, one outside. Neither feels real anymore. I get angry over small things, irritated to the point where I feel like my blood vessels might burst if I don’t scream. My thoughts race so much that I can’t always tell what actually happened and what I imagined. It’s terrifying.

I’ve lost trust in doctors after I heard him (my doctor) talk about patients like they were jokes to others (i saw him). That broke the trust and hope in me. I stopped believing that help was even possible.  And the doctors were only pretending to care to get the consultation fees.

I used to be the funny one or i tried to be . The idiot among friends who made people laugh. But lately, that version of me ,  I now dont understand the way I thought at that time, what i was hoping for , its like that me was only my imagination .  I don’t recognize myself now— I now became someone who pushes people away, who hates how everyone else seems to connect while I feel like the odd one out. 

I also need to say this: I once tried to harm myself. I failed, but the scars remain. I don’t know what I’ll say if someone asks about them. I’m scared of being judged, of being seen as weak or unstable. But the truth is, I was hurting so badly I didn’t know what else to do.

I’m not posting this for attention. I just want someone to understand. To talk to me without judgment. I don’t want to start with my name or surface-level stuff. I want to be seen for who I am underneath all this pain."
👉 OCD isn’t “being neat.” It’s more like having a brain gremlin stuck on repeat.,8,4,2025-09-08 13:29:59,"OCD isn’t about being “super tidy” or “loving cleaning.” (If it was, my house wouldn’t look like a sock crime scene right now.)

*It’s about getting stuck in loops of intrusive thoughts and compulsions that feel impossible to break.*

Some unhelpful things people say:

* “Just don’t think about it.” → That’s like saying “just don’t breathe.”
* “You’d never actually do that!” → OCD knows too. It just doesn’t care.
* “Wow, that’s messed up.” → Congrats, you’ve now made them feel like a monster *and* given OCD a high-five.

What actually helps?

* 🧪 **Exposure & Response Prevention (ERP)** → facing the fear without doing the ritual, teaching your brain it’s not the boss.
* 💊 **Medication** → sometimes an SSRI just takes the edge off so therapy can do its thing.
* 👂 **Steady support** → don’t panic, don’t dismiss, just be a human seatbelt.

OCD is brutal, but it’s treatable. With the right support, the gremlin *can* shut up.

**Curious how others here explain OCD to friends or family without it getting reduced to “you just like cleaning.”**"

DAE feel like doing the opposite of what they really want to do when angry or stressed? Something like self-destructing?,1,0,2025-09-08 13:14:41,"Does anyone else feel like doing the opposite of what they really want to do when angry or stressed? Or saying you don't want something when actually you do? Or do the thing you don't want on purpose even if you will regret it later (most of the time people do what they want on impulse, but I do the opposite).
I don't know how to explain it but I'll give some examples.

1. When I was 9-10, my dad told me to throw out all my artwork cause it was useless. I got so upset and went ahead and tossed them all out, thinking 'you think I can't, I'll show you I don't care'. Regretted it terribly later of course. 

2. When I was 3, my grandma told me I once got super upset over a toy and cried that I didn't want it after all when I actually did.

3. Sometimes I feel like deleting all my personal creative work. Like straight up deleting everything and ghosting everyone following me on all my socials. Better yet, just vanishing. Sometimes this is accompanied by delusion that no one will care (despite knowing it's not the case). I actually made a 'kill switch' and felt myself calm down after testing it out for a minute before feeling guilty and undoing it. 

4. Or chucking everything I own out of my room and just destroying it to the point of no return despite knowing I'll regrettably cry about it later. 

5. When I was 13, I also used to pretend I didn't like my crush and would act like I hated him (not to the point of a real life 'tsundere' or Helga from Arnold).

6. When I was 17 and making the second biggest decision of my life about school, I did what my dad said and picked a tech course over art, all because of a phone call where he screamed at me that I was being stupid picking something useless. I remember changing my course to what he wanted last minute out of fear, but also out of some self destructive behaviour. So I ruined my own life in that scenario.

7. Not exactly the same, but I tend to starve myself when angry. I once got so angry at my mother/father, I skipped meals the entire day until I felt faint when I got out of bed. When stressed at work, I eat very little too.

In my family, we have a term for this kind of behaviour where you 'say you don't want something despite wanting it' but there's no such equivalent in the English language. 

I've never cut before but I imagined myself cutting and I can see why it would feel good in the moment. It's like letting it all out and just watching yourself descend into chaos and losing yourself like you no longer give a damn.

I'm just curious about the psychology behind this."
I’m finding it hard to care about work or anything really.,1,0,2025-09-08 13:13:16,"I know it might sound dumb or maybe even paranoid but with everything that happening in the world I’m having a really rough time giving a fuck about work or anything and been very depressed, not being able to sleep and just very irritated. Not that work is that important or anything, I’m really just here for a paycheck but I am constantly concerned with what going to happen with my family (wife and two kids). I don’t really think anything is going to keep me from having constant anxiety. The only thing that kinda helps is just being with my family but while I’m at work or even just stepping away from them for a minute I just go straight back to thinking about everything and what I can do about it but it seems more and more that there’s nothing I can do. I’ve always been a calm kinda person always go with the flow and if shit doesn’t go my way, that’s fine, I’ll move on but now I have a family and the world seems to be falling apart as I’m trying to build mine up and I’m just overwhelmed. I guess this is more of just venting than asking for help but yeah…"
Slacking off at work and feeling guilty,3,0,2025-09-08 12:57:10,"What to do when I feel under stimulated at work and I can't force myself to work on tasks? I am medicated and I go to therapy. I am slacking off at work, manager have never told that I am not working enough. But I am afraid they will notice it eventually. I find my job meaningless a bit, I find it hard to motivate myself to work. This job is well paid and isn't too stressful, I am afraid of changing job, afraid that I would also be bored at new job I feel stuck."
I hate extrasystoles,1,0,2025-09-08 12:56:39,"Every time I say I have ""palpitations"" people think I just feel my heart beating harder, faster, or not beating. **No, it's not that**

It's a sudden pounding in the chest from within, as if the heart had choked. Or a fluttering. It's not fun. I hav like 5-7 per day, and I know they have already made me an electrocardiogram, But I've never had a palpitation during an EKG, so I'm still scared. 
Unfortunately, I'm scared of asking the doctor to take me to the cardiologist, because I know it could be anxiety and I don't want to look like I'm delulu (my parents' fault). And I also don't know to what extent a specific electrocardiogram rules something out, maybe he sees me as ignorant. 

I'm just scared, I've been like this since January."
Why is this world so unbelievably unfair?,1,1,2025-09-08 12:44:28,"I know adult life is hard for most everybody. But my life has been falling apart for months now and everytime I think 'It couldn't get worse than this'It does. IT FUCKING DOES. 
I just went through an extensive hiring process, having to complete a bunch of courses, tests, background tests, and drug tests every single thing. EVERYTHING came back fine and I recieved a call telling me to complete the on-boarding paperwork, 30 minutes later, the link expires and I can't get in so what do I do? I call and email, no response for 3 days. Cool, class starts Monday so I'll go early to make sure I can complete everything. I get here an hour early and what do I get? 
""Oh sorry, hr lady says she sent an email(she didn't), we can't accept you because something else came up on your background check that, even though you told us about it beforehand and we told you it was fine, is not allowed. So. Sorry, go home too bad so sad, we know you did everything we asked and bought everything that was required even though you had to scrape the money together just to get it all because you haven't be able to find work literally anywhere else, but it's out of our hands, I'll show you the way out"" 

I cannot do this anymore, I really don't see any other way out. I relapsed with S/H not that long ago and it's getting to the point that I'm emotionally stunted and not as afraid of the injury going too deep.

"Terrified by a spider, need support",2,2,2025-09-08 12:36:02,"Well, as the title says. I had a very unpleasant encounter with a spider this morning and I need a bit of support because I'm much more shaken than I'd expect. I'm generally fine with smaller spiders and insects, but this morning I woke up to a 4 cm monster hanging from the ceiling above my bed. It's not Australia size, but very big for my area. I had a strong fearful reaction immediately, but as I'm an adult, I needed to deal with the situation so I sucked it up and tried to kill it. I managed, but it took quite long, and it wasn't very graceful (I'll spare you the details). To my own surprise, I had goosebumps and shivers all over my body, just as a startled animal. I even noticed very dilated pupils when I saw myself in the mirror. My mind was foggy the whole morning after and I barely got off to work. Now, I feel like there are huge spiders in every crevice and I can't shake the goosebumps, I'm constantly on the edge. It feels gross and I just don't feel very good right now. Any tips on how to deal with the fear? I'm aware that 99% of the time there aren't giant spiders waiting to eat me, I just got scared and I need a bit of encouragement probably.
And bless the spider's soul, I'm so sorry I had to kill it. If I could, I would toss it out the window, I just couldn't handle it."
I was finally doing better and then I bloody slipped into ruining myself anyway,1,0,2025-09-08 12:35:59,"Y'know I was thinking I was finally starting to organise myself a bit better. I even got a regular workout routine going. And I started doing some more productive stuff, at least creative work, much better than just trying to kill time, right?

And today I realised that ever since I spent the entirety of the last Friday working on a damn map I pretty much haven't stopped. I didn't even sleep on Saturday. It's horrible. I was just happy to finally have some motivation to work on something but at this point I feel my body and mind giving out again. I'm barely awake enough to walk, nevermind actually do more important things I wanted to do today. 

I hate this stupid cycle. Why is it that every time I start enjoying literally anything I can't help but run myself ragged until I burn out again? What the fuck am I even supposed to do at this point?"

"How can I support my boyfriend (CPTSD, Bipolar Disorder, Narcissistic traits) while managing my own BPD?",1,2,2025-09-08 12:34:12,"Hi everyone,

I really want some advice on how to strengthen my relationship with my boyfriend. Although we have been together for a year, and things are going great and all, but some days tend to get rough and overly heated due to a lot of arguments. We are both teenagers, and I plan on moving in with him soon (after a year or so, due to the fact I am living in a horrible household, and I have a good relationship with his family).

I have borderline personality disorder, and it really hurts me every single day. My emotions feel so intense and overwhelming that even small things can make me spiral. It’s exhausting living with constant fear of abandonment, mood swings, and feeling like I’m not in control of myself. Sometimes I feel broken inside, and it makes relationships even harder because I want love and security so badly, but my emotions can take over in painful ways and I have little to no control over them. But my boyfriend is extremely sweet and he tries his best to make everyday a perfect experience for me.

He has bipolar disorder, C-PTSD, and his therapist has told him that he shows strong narcissistic traits. Day to day, he is extremely sweet, caring, and loving toward me. But when we get into a fight, he immediately becomes very defensive and can get  mean. The problem is, those moments really trigger me. When he reacts like that, I end up feeling overwhelmed and saying or doing horrible things that I regret afterwards. I can't handle my emotions at all and it can be very horrible for me AND him whenever I split or act impulsively, whether it's with my words or with my actions. It turns into a cycle where both of us feel hurt and unwanted, and I want to break out of that pattern. I know this is part of how he reacts when he feels attacked, but it can be really hard on both of us. I love him deeply, and I truly want to make our relationship safe, comfortable, and healthy for both of us. I don’t want him to feel unsupported, and I also don’t want our conflicts to damage what we have. 

So my only questions are, How can I:

- Support him without enabling unhealthy patterns

- Respect his space while still building closeness

- Communicate better during conflicts or when either of us feels triggered

- Create more stability and reassurance in the relationship

I also really want to know how I can become better at managing my BPD. I struggle with being overly jealous, impulsive, and I constantly overthink everything. I let my emotions take control of me instead of staying calm, and it ends up making situations worse. I don’t want to keep repeating the same mistakes, I want to learn healthier ways to cope, think, and react so I can be a better partner and also feel more in control of myself. I deal with depressive states, suicidal thoughts, and even self-harm when it all feels too heavy, and it is leaving a bad impact on me. Ofcourse, my boyfriend has always been there for me and he has tried to make me get better everyday, but I know that he is also not doing mentally well himself. (P.S. don't worry, I am also on a journey to find the perfect therapist for me where I can feel comfortable, but for now, I want some advice from other people here).

I deal with depressive states, suicidal thoughts, and sometimes even self-harm when it all feels too heavy.

Any insights, advice, or resources would mean so much to me because I don't want this relationship to end, and me and him can definitely agree on that. Thank you!"
I don't know what is wrong with me,2,0,2025-09-08 12:31:59,"Some background information: I am 19 years old, male, from a Southeast Asian country that I won't clarify. Currently studying in university, active in multiple co-curriculum activities and societies. All around, a pretty decent life with a typical childhood with divorced parents. My friends would describe me as a guy that's always happy, I would to if I didn't have this ""thing"" on me.

The problem: once a month since 2019, I will lose all of my energy, my will to socialise, and I'll just lock myself up in my room for the entire day. I don't know what the problem is. On those days that I lock myself up in my room, I always feel like the moment I go downstairs to the living room, the whole world will crash on me, even in my room it felt as if I am being judged by the walls, but that is the only place I feel ""safe"" in. On those days, if I were to actually go down, it is as if every word spoken to me is filled with malice. 

On those days, I'd usually wake up late (around 1PM to 3PM) but the night before I'd sleep early (not uber-early, abouth 9 to 10). The moment I wake up, the fatigue of waking up is different than the usual ""I don't wanna get out of bed"", it was like I was tied to the bed. I'd sit up and still feel like crap, so I just lie down, the entire day. And this has been going on every month without fail, it used to be more often in 2019 to 2021 (like 5 times a month back then), and it started to decline for a bit, and now it is happening once every month, on a random day. My problem is a bit light when compared to the other things on this subreddit, but I really want to fix this thing. I don't have access to psyciatric care here currently, and the campus counselling unit is not confidential. I apologise if my question is dumb, but what is wrong with me? I feel so helpless."

Do I need to go to the doctor about OCD?,1,1,2025-09-08 12:14:35,"I’m (22,F) like 95% sure I have ocd, I’ve been asked by multiple diagnosed ocd people if I have it too. When I think back I can trace it all the way back to being around 6 years old and there’s things that make sense now that I’ve thought about the possibility of me having ocd.

It obviously shows up in many different ways for me and there’s some parts of it that DO affect my daily life but not to the point that it’s unmanageable just now. I do pull my hair and spent some time with no eyebrows or lashes when I was younger and sometimes my intrusive thoughts can be overwhelming but it’s nothing that I’d want to be medicated for just yet. 

I would like a diagnosis just to know but I’m not really bothered about treatment rn so would I be wasting NHS time if I went to my gp about it.

Drowsy on Antidepressant,1,0,2025-09-08 11:52:24,"I'm a 27F. I've been on Zoloft about 2 months. My psychiatric nurse starting me a 25 mg for 6 weeks, to see how I could handle the side effects. I had moderate depression, but serious behavioral issues from borderline personality disorder, which she diagnosed me with. 

I was harassing and calling the job and contacting the family, of a guy who didn't want to date me, and kept me at friends with benefits. You met online, and we're in contact, and hanging out periodically, for 8 months. I lost it when he tried to break things off after moving away.

Anyhow, my psychiatric nurse bumped me up to 50 mg. I had few side effects, except slight fatigue, until now. After 3 weeks of being on 50 mg, I am so drowsy. I took the dose in the evening, before heading to the gym. I was falling asleep on the treadmill. I slept 9 hours, woke up and I'm still super drowsy. I have to go to work.

Academic hell,1,0,2025-09-08 11:51:17,"So for starters my academic life was like living hell. My parents especially my mom was really paranoid about my future. So, like any good asian parent, she put my academic life into overdrive very early in kindergarten. I was drllied with the message that ""No studying equals no good life"". I was verbally punished for making errors(often physically ). Any negative feedback from teachers triggered my parents and they would start naggig and berating me. Speaking of teachers, they well... Lets just say they were reluctant people trying to make ends meet for themselves, they weren’t' really interested in teaching as much as they were at criticising and humaliting students. This pattern went along through all the grades. From 3rd grade my Parents hired tutors for. They hired quite a few across the years. What i can say from experience, is that They tested the amount of academic stress i could handle. From childhood to pre twenties my life amounte to how much grade i would get in school. There was no room for mistakes. From parents to teachers any sort of underperformance to them was worth punishment. The toxicity was'nt just limited to school or family, the Society treated underperforming childern as failures. As i could remember my early life was just wake up go to school, get criticised and punished by teachers, return home get berated by parents, study, get punished for your mistakes. Looking back i found that education around most countries is a mistake. 
Currently i am taking therapy for the long term stress and burnout of this, situation."
It’s okay not to be okay every single time,5,2,2025-09-08 11:50:16,"There’s a lot of pressure online to always be “working on yourself” or “getting better,” but healing isn’t a straight line. Some days are wins, some days are setbacks, and both are part of the process.

During the day, sometimes the colors and the environment around me seem ""dead"" or, at other times, very vivid and colorful. My vision has also worsened, despite wearing glasses, which bothers me a lot.

I don't know what's happening or if other people feel the same way, but it's really affecting me.  I will only be able to get an appointment with the psychiatrist in two months due to high demand."
"I'm emotionally unavailable, it's ruining everything",1,1,2025-09-08 11:23:04,"I don't even know where to start. I'm so tired of everything, my partner seems like he's always complaining. Tonight he said I don't give any emotional support, I feel like I have nothing left to give. Like I'm just an empty shell. I'm just so broken and don't know where to begin."
Mental disorder in relationships,1,0,2025-09-08 11:21:13,"Just me myself questioning how to handle my anxiety when in a relationship. I feel like I'm emotionally depending on my partner and expect too much from him.

I've been struggling with anxiety and depression all my life until I was put on medication the past 4 years. I had been with my current partner for 3 years now, and I can see him as my future husband. He is a genuine nice guy who is kind to me and everyone around. I was drawn to him at first cause of his kindness.

However there are time that I question my decision to stay with him, especially when my anxiety acted up. There are a few times now that I forgot to take my med because I ran out of script (accidentally). According to him it turned me to a completely different person. I'm usually lively and bubbly when I'm on it. But without the med, I'm vulnerable and easily sad. 

I realized that when I'm not on my med he would not want to talk to me too much because I'm usually upset. Might just be his way of giving me space. This might be from my extreme down mood and crying when I'm off med and nothing could make me feel better. But I think it has left a bad imprint in him that when I'm off med I'm a terrible person and hard to deal with. It's better to leave me alone until I got my med.

But to me it feels like I've been abandoned by the one I loved and I started to panic and crumbled. He said he just want to have a good time and not feel sad. This to me is like he dismissed my feelings, it makes me angry and disappointed. 

 
Usually I just bawl my eyes out until I'm able to collect myself bit by bit, gather the courage to talk to him and express my feeling. Somehow it turned into arguments every time. We would make up after that and continue with our lives. 

However I can't shake off the feeling that I chose the wrong person. I really want to build a family with him and have kid, but I question the idea each time this happens. I just want to be seen and to be excepted as who I am, even my vulnerable self. But maybe that's expecting too much from him. I'm scared to think about having a baby with my mental state, it would be miserable for us all.

How do you guys deal with your mental disorder in relationships?"
Years of healing being put on pause because of a Mass.,2,0,2025-09-08 11:10:53,"I (22F) started therapy 4 and a half years ago for PTSD and anxiety, much of it stemming from growing up around my mom’s and sister’s mental health struggles (schizophrenia, psychosis). It left me anxious about the future, finances, and constantly pushing myself to “be the best.” Therapy helped me understand my reactions and cope better.

Until May, I was in school, but realized I needed to prioritize my health. I pulled back from friends, worked on positive habits, and focused on therapy. In July, I began seeing a psychiatrist and started medication. For the first time, my mind felt clear and my energy returned. I’m grateful for the support I have now.

Another big part of my journey has been reproductive health. I stopped birth control at 18 after experiencing mood swings, depression, spotting, and irregular periods. Since then, my cycles remained irregular. I’ve been with my boyfriend (23M) for 4 and half years, mostly without protection the past 3. At first, I thought birth control was still in my system, but I now know that was misinformation. My periods were always unpredictable. Sometimes early, late, or even twice in a month.

This year, symptoms worsened. In June, spotting became heavy bleeding. I developed sharp pain in my right lower abdomen and tailbone, began bleeding after sex, and often had two cycles a month. In July, I finally told my therapist, who urged me to see a gynecologist. I already had an appointment scheduled with a Planned Parenthood midwife.

At the visit, my provider listened, asked questions, and ordered an ultrasound. In early September, I had it done. The next morning, the results showed two abnormally shaped masses on my right ovary and another in my uterus. I immediately messaged my midwife, who called me right away. She said the radiologist wanted more imaging since the masses didn’t look like cysts. She warned me it could be cancer and referred me for an MRI and gynecologist follow-up.

Oddly, I felt calm. I had suspected something was wrong and was tired of being told to “just go on birth control.” I finally felt taken seriously. Still, the thought of infertility hit me hard. I’ve always wanted children with my partner.

I cried, but my meds helped me bounce back. My boyfriend and I have been planning our future. He’s starting his career as a police officer, and I just passed an IT interview. In a couple years, we plan to move in together and build our life.

This has been overwhelming, but I wanted to share to raise awareness. If you have irregular cycles, pain, or bleeding, please advocate for yourself. This isn’t the end of my healing journey. I truly believe I can overcome this."
Natural selection view on mental health,3,2,2025-09-08 10:49:07,"Someone told me that life is just natural selection. In the sense of survival of the fittest. Either you function in society (where nobody cares how you feel) or you rot with a victim mentality or you end up killing yourself. I can see the logic in that, but it puts so much pressure on me.

Whenever I say how much this affects me people see my need to be understood as weakness. That’s all I’ve ever gotten when I reached out even as a teenager never comfort just the harsh truth. Now it feels like everyone expects me to suddenly function normally after all those years. And if I don’t I’m labeled a victim or I’m weak and blaming others for my problems. 

It feels like the absolute truth and I end up not only struggling but also feeling guilty for struggling. So does this mindset actually help me move forward and should I internalize it?"

What medication has worked for your excessive fear and hyperactive amygdala?,2,2,2025-09-08 10:24:37,"Hi. My main problem is fear. I experience excessive fear in almost every situation.
Whenever I find myself in a new situation(imagined or real), my mind quickly creates a fearful narrative, and for a moment, I feel intense fear and anxiety though it usually passes after a short while. I can become afraid of nearly anything, even from hearing someone else's story. It feels like my amygdala is extremely overactive.

Right now I can't do exposure therapy because the fear is too intense.

I’d like to know what medication has helped you manage an overactive amygdala?"

"Struggling with exams, depression, and focus – need advice",2,1,2025-09-08 09:49:52,"Hi everyone,
I’m in 12th grade right now and my exams are really close. I’m on medication for depression and anxiety, and while I’ve been trying to study, I just can’t focus properly.

Math makes more sense to me, but physics and chemistry feel impossible right now. I’ve also missed a lot of classes, so I feel like I know almost nothing compared to where I should be. The pressure is making me even more depressed, and I don’t know how to get out of this cycle.

For those of you who’ve been in a similar situation, how did you manage to push through? Did anything help you cope with the stress and actually study? Any advice or personal experiences would mean a lot right now.
And lastly, I have been sleeping a lot.😴

Thanks in advance."

"Hi. I am 40 years old, have OCD, I have been partially isolated since 19 and I have never had a girlfriend. I feel extremely lonely and I have lost hope in life. I don't know what to do. Does anyone relate to my situation? I hate modern shallow world. I really suffer it and I don't like this period.",1,0,2025-09-08 08:36:08,"Hi. I am 40 years old and I see that OCD is increasingly damaging my mind. I forget things, I am unfocused, I tolerate changes less, I get tense very easily, I am more fearful and so on. I stopped having a social and active life, let's say normal or functional, at the age of 19. I locked myself in a bubble in the hope that I would find a cure for my disorder and unfortunately, I lost my youth without improving, which is a horrible burden that has often made me become very depressed and feel such a great degree of nostalgia and regret that it makes me think about suicide. I have never had a girlfriend and I stopped having friends. For many years I was fine with it and I even enjoyed my loneliness, my misery, my depression, my isolation and my lack of connection and harmony with the outside world. The problem is that for about 7 years now, this has finally taken its toll on me, especially the fact that I have never had a girlfriend or sexual experiences. My libido has increased, I develop crushes very easily and I become attached to many women that I barely know or with whom I have minimal contact in a store, street, etc. My rational part tells me that it is not a real love, but my obsessive disorder is characterized by sabotaging myself and making me magnify many things. I ended up stopping going out and going to school because I brainwashed myself and got this idea that I couldn't speak, that I was very hungry, that I liked vulgar and disgusting things, etc. Even to this day I can get a feeling of hunger if someone insults me while I'm driving or if someone says a mocking comment to me. This can cause me to not be able to speak or any of my negative ideas. All day I feel a tickle of anxiety in my mouth. It's not leaving anymore. I also can't speak naturally because there is almost always the fear of losing the topic of conversation, not knowing what to say and get the other person bored. I imagine scenarios asking a woman out and I know that at any moment I could lose the ability to converse fluently and therefore, bore her. Plus, my self-esteem is on the floor. I have felt disgusting in the eyes of women since I was a a little boy. I've tried Tinder, Bumble, and other apps without much success, which has affected my self-esteem even more. Sometimes I can't stand the urge to have sex and it bothers me a lot because I also tend to have animosity towards women. I would like to be asexual or not have a libido. I also wish I didn't feel this need to socialize, but I can't. It's already overtaken me and all these years of isolation have finally sabotaged me and my body and mind are crying out for social contact. I really regret not having been braver in the few opportunities I had to have a girlfriend or sexual relations. I think that if I had had these experiences, right now I wouldn't have this need to date a woman. It would be the same as what I feel with friends. I did have friends, I know what that is like and therefore, I don't need them. If I had had a girlfriend and sex, that would now only be a reminder that I was once able to be functional. I would already know what that is and therefore, I could concentrate on other things and even close that chapter. To make matters worse, my disorder makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong when I suddenly have the opportunity to talk to women more or less my age. I feel something ridiculous and disgusting that makes me feel like I'm cheating on my mom and my brother. Ridiculous."
How do I help my partner with avoidant attachment?,1,1,2025-09-08 09:24:10,"I am a 25M dating a 22F, we’ve been dating for about 2.5 years now. Recently we’ve been having a lot of issues because she had nearly full control of the relationship for a while and I was trying to wrestle some of that back from her. I felt like the more I pushed her to do things she didn’t want to do, the more she pulled away from me. We went to a couple’s therapist who informed us that we both have negative attachment types, I have anxious and she has avoidant. I immediately agreed to try to improve myself because I don’t want to be toxic, but she just refused to admit she had an issue. She seems to be in denial, basically, that anything is wrong, and would rather just ignore the issue even though it isn’t something that can be ignored. She loves me and has said as much, and doesn’t want our relationship to end, but every time I try to bring up her avoidant attachment we just end up arguing in circles until she gets mad and storms off. I want to help her, because once you acknowledge the problem it’s far easier to get help, but the very nature of avoidant attachment makes that difficult. If anybody knows how I can help her, I would really appreciate some advice.

I also will not accept any comments saying that I should leave her. I’ve seen hundreds of people on the internet saying that people with avoidant attachment are selfish monsters who will only hurt you. As someone with emotional trauma of my own I refuse to pigeonhole somebody for their own. We all cope in different ways and she needs help, not ridicule and scorning."

My mistakes in my childhood,1,2,2025-09-08 09:01:11,"Hi guys.I should tell you this that since 2020 till 2024 I was a porn addictor and I discovered pornography when I was 12 years old.And in that time I watched a few hentais or domains that a that child is the doer in relationships with a woman I watched that content when I was 13 and 14 or maximum 15 years old.I never watched a real porn with persons under the 18 years old but now I am really shameful because of that and in my country our parent or schools don't really teach us about that
 now I nearly 18 years old and I never want to watch that content again.please guys tell me that I am really a pedophile or not"
Why am I never happy or normal?,1,1,2025-09-08 08:59:19,"Sorry for the title, couldn't think of something fitting to the stuff I'm about to say. CW for sui thoughts and some eating disorders.

So... I've been struggling to do much with my life, other than being stuck in an endless loop since I started my first job at the start of this year at my early 20s.

To explain what I mean, I'll break it down in pieces.

Firstly, If I per say, tell myself that I'm setting rules on the amount of non-neccesities (like comfort food) I'm allowed to buy, or tell myself that I'm going to start   learning this and that in my off-time, absolutely nothing happens.
I then go and make other plans and tell myself how I'm only allowed to only buy comfort food once a week, but that also does not work.

Many things I've done in attempt to change my life has failed. And every single time I do the same cycle, but different approach in attempt to trick myself into doing it, but to no avail.


Onto the next thing... I can't seem to be able to tell what my current feeling or emotion is, or how it feels to miss, love, or care about someone. I do my best to find ways to make myself see that I'm not emotionless, but it's as if I have some unexplainable mental block...


Then we have the thing of me not being able to figure out who I am. Am I just the person everyone sees me as, or am I supposed to be someone else? For a while If I called my name in my head, I saw nothing. More recently if I called my name in my head, I started seeing someone in my head. Can't see their face, but I see something I'd likely never be able to become, something that I've given up on because I know my living conditions won't allow it.


To give more context: a few years ago, I, a ""male"" discovered through a series of mini-events that I was never supposed to be that. I knew I was supposed to be something else... up untill recently, where I've been debating it with myself.Sadly the only people I had to talk to about that were my few queer online friends, and have been up untill recently. 

Also recently (1-2 months ago) I cut myself off from the last few online friends I had, in attempt to have my body and mind fix itself. But it's as if nothing is happening, and only getting worse.
I'm also starting to get worse work performance wise, making more mistakes than I should ever have been, and I realize that the only reason I have not ended it all, is because my parents threatened me with ""what about us? Have you thought of what we will go through if you unalive yourself?"" and because of this job that I have.

I can't find a reason to live. I can't find goals to set for myself. I can't find ways to turn my life around without walls being built in my path. 

On a last note: I don't have friends. I used to have a few online friends, but it's not the same as someone supporting you in person. Every single ""friend"" I've had in my life either misused me, abused me, or used me to make an example of, so that's why I stayed away from any offline activity, and still do due to how toxic the people around me is. 

And look... I know I have not given much info, but it is because this is a fresh Reddit account, and I'm doing my best to not be too revealing. But please... Just help me in whatever way any of yous can, if you can make sense of what I've just said."

How do I explain to my dr i stopped my meds suddenly.,5,12,2025-09-08 08:24:38,"So I've been on antidepressants for the last several months. I honestly can say they had any real effect i got all of the more uncommon side effects without feeling any noticeable benefit. 
The last few weeks I was feeling extremely low with persistent suicidal thoughts and I was discussing with my therapist about asking my dr to trying a new med. She wrote a letter to my dr expressing concern for my level of suicidality (as I hadn't brought this up with my dr)  and I made an appointment.
Over the weekend I unintentionally missed a dose of my meds for the first time. Then the following day I just couldn't make myself take it.. im not even sure why. Now im on day 3 of no meds and I feel... sooo much better. The suicidal thoughts are gone and I feel so much more positive and have more motivation. I know I shouldn't stop meds so suddenly and it wasn't my intention to do so but now I cant make myself take them knowing how much better I feel! 
I dont know how to explain this to my dr or if I even want to go back on any meds now.. 
Does anyone have any advise on how to explain it to my dr or what else could be going on to make me feel so drastically different so suddenly ??"

"Does your mental illness ever put you in a situation, where it feels like you have “no choice,” but to move on?",6,1,2025-09-08 08:19:31,"I’ve been dealing with so much lately, and I’m just disappointed. I will say, I’m a prayerful man, and believe in God.

It’s just ridiculous. There were literally times where I would eat food, and it would taste absolutely disgusting, spontaneously. But when I eat the same type of food another day, I’m fine. Then, when I’m walking, my body may walk in one direction, but on the outside of my body, it feels like an evil force, or someone, is pushing me around, making me walk funny, walk faster/slower at times. It’s ridiculous. I’ve called on the name of Jesus, many times, but it just seems like I keep dealing with the same struggles. I’ve been dealing with this for 3 years, I’ve been on antipsychotic medication for 3 years, and I currently talk to my medication management doctor every few weeks, and a therapist once a week. I just feel upset, because I just want to live better. I also see things, like when the evil force does something bad to me, I’ll see a laughing emoji, like the one that’s on an iPhone, and I’ll see it, as if the voice is happy to see me struggle. I’m just frustrated with God. I still love him, and I’m doing the best I can to still worship him, but this battle is very frustrating. I hope it ends one day, on this earth, and that I can live a good, life, like I used to…🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽"
I barely feel like a person anymore and it’s exhausting,1,0,2025-09-08 08:18:16,"This is going to be somewhat of rant, just trying to get some stuff out. I can’t put it all in one post of course but I’m just going to start. I feel like I have so much to say but even trying to gather the energy to write about it is a struggle. Writing was something I used to enjoy, even though it was superficial and prompted (through school.) It was one of the few subjects I felt I was decent at, math and science just made me feel completely incompetent and unintelligent. I still feel stupid most of the time. 


Im a 24 y/o woman who’s dealt with mental health struggles from a young age, mainly anxiety and some OCD tendencies. More recently depression. Anxiety is still the most prevalent form of mental illness I deal with in my day to day life. I was put on SSRI’s when I was 10-11 years old and I think it did more harm than good. To be honest, I don’t think that children should be on any non medically necessary medication, particularly psychiatric. I’ve tried several and never had any improvement, I don’t take anything now besides as needed anxiety meds.


I was being bullied at my elementary school around that time; it’s funny because I don’t really remember why. Perhaps my brain has blocked it out but I think it was likely a combination of factors. I’ve thought about asking my parents. If I had to guess I would say it was related to me being quiet and shy, and also being quite tall for a girl. Obviously the experience I was having in school made for an anxious existence. I went through middle school with a couple good friends but it was still crappy. Of course it sucks for everyone but I was extremely sensitive to criticism from both adults and the other students. 


I’ve always been a very sensitive person and still am to this day. Not exactly sure where that comes from but even someone making a joke can make me feel like shit about myself sometimes. I’ve had a lot of trauma in my life. I just completely internalize any type of criticism, rejection, critique, etc. I think sometimes it’s warranted but other times I need to not take things so personally, or just not care so much. I often feel like everyone is mad at me or secretly hates me. Even when I walk by people on the street and I overhear laughing, I think it must be them making fun of me. 


My energy levels have been incredibly low recently, like constant fatigue even after 10+ hours of sleep. I can’t remember the last time I woke up refreshed. I envy people who can spend their weekends constantly doing things instead of just laying down. At times just getting up to get water feels like a feat, like my body is stuck. I do sometimes get surges of energy though. 


I have a few friends but most of them are older then me and aren’t always around. Im lucky to have the ones I do but I still feel very insecure about the amount of friends I have. I’ve met loads of acquaintances, but the amount of people I have to to actually hang out with regularly is very small. I could definitely work harder to make new connections (I’ve been trying) but it also a lot takes a lot of mental work and energy for me. 

Sometimes just making conversation (with anyone) can be exhausting. I don’t know for sure if I’m on the autism spectrum but I do feel like I have some traits of both autism and adhd. Only things I’ve been diagnosed with are anxiety and some form of depression. It’s hard to differentiate between all these different labels. Ok I’m running out of characters so I’m gonna leave it here."

I’ve tried different combinations of antidepressants and antipsychotics, mood stabilizers. Nothing works. The anxiety makes me wanna rip my skin off, my depression has me laying in a mess of my own making. I’m paranoid and hear things all the time. But I function I go to work and school.

Constant mental struggle.,1,0,2025-09-08 07:11:48,"Im not sure the best way to approach this but I will get to the point. I feel like I’m a shit person. A person who has done bad thing, whatever you want to call it. I’ve done shitty things to people in my past and have always regretted it and felt guilt wash over me almost instantly, I was very impulsive and confused as a teenager and it seems no matter how hard I’ve tried to learn from my mistakes and forgive myself and be a better person, the guilt and shame washes over me all the same. I think about killing myself multiple times everyday. I like to think in recent years I’ve become a better person. Everyday I actively try to make the life’s of others better and go out of my way to be nice to even people who do not treat others nicely. I relate to them and want the best for them. Any time I have alone in my head, I’m back at square one, wanting to kill myself. I sit and replay my life in my head and it feels embarrassing for me to even be alive. I don’t know how much more self help it will take before I won’t want to commit suicide anymore but i can’t see a ‘light at the end of the tunnel’ so to speak, and I feel like I never will. I’m running out of places to turn to."
"I made my life hell, now paying for it by end*ng it all",1,0,2025-09-08 07:11:48,"Hi there,

I am from India, I just turned 25 last week, My life has been going on a downward spiral since I was in my end of high school, I believe it all started with comparison trap then I decided to run away from everywhere I find a slight bit of competition. In college, I found many peers so focused, so extrovert, so brilliant than me, it developed anxiety and depression, I started suffocating myself with the thoughts that I will never be better or at the same level as others. I was never a confident or outgoing kid, I had a small friend circle in school and I never tried to make new friends ever till now. Anyways those suffocating, depressive thoughts led me in front of metro track where I decided to jump as soon as I heard the metro was coming, well eventually I didn't do it, I got into the metro and came back home. I crying and pleaded to my parents that I should drop out of college as it is making me wanna kill myself, I assured them that within a year I would make an income stream for myself, well that didn't happened either. I just felt so light headed after dropping out, I fueled my already existing procrastination to the max of it's ability, always saying that I'll do it tomorrow, I learnt 5 min of different skills and decided it's not for me and started watching anime or YouTube, it was my everyday routine, I lied to my parents saying that everything is going fine and well, I kept them into the darkness for years, they are so sweet, they would help me in every situation possible but I just am tired of disappointing, lying, making them feel there is hope. I just want to end this pain for myself and them. They don't deserve a mentally ill freeloader of a son.

I have depression, anxiety, fear for failure, analysis paralysis, inferiority complex, fear of change, no desires, no confidence, no communication skills, no high paying skills, no degree, lack of discipline,I am obese, gooner, in a despair loop and tired of trying.

And above all, I cannot see a good future for myself, I don't believe anything good will ever happen, this feeling is so crushing that d3ath feels comforting and the only way out. I wish I could go back in time to change a few decisions but that's not how reality works, the reality is I made my life hell to the point where even living for a minute seems heavy. I love my mummy papa, I am just sad that they got a failure of a son as myself. I hope they move on for better once I am gone.

In the end, I just wanna know if there is any last hope or anything left for me? Do any of you have some good idea for a person in a same situation as me? Even if you don't it's fine. Maybe this was my destiny all along.

Thank you for reading all this :)"
I Don’t Want To Be Here,1,0,2025-09-08 06:39:18,I am so tired I was going to write a big long thing about how I am no longer smart and how I let all of my potential go and how I want to be hurt because it’s more comfortable than excepting help but I have no energy I want to die but can’t. I just want to disappear into the background I can’t just lie down I keep going down a road with nothing waiting for me but I can’t stop I want to fall over but I will always catch myself as to not be seen or heard or noticed I have nothing no reason to live not one person would care if I did and I want to but I can’t. Had so much potential I was such a bright kid I was so happy and I had friends I ruined everything for myself and so I will march on forever and with every step I will regret all those that came before until I have marched so far from everything I will finally allow myself the beautiful release of death
What happen if I do?,1,0,2025-09-08 07:42:03,"Should I keep my current state ? I'm currently feeling low emotion because of heavy smoking. This keeps my mind sane and not numb.I used to have strong emotions but I can work on everything now without any emotional effect. This condition also makes my feelings become minor wherever positive or negative feelings. I can sleep well but my appetite has become choices and not getting affected by emotion like it used to. I can still sense the taste and judge the food, however I don’t eat as much as before. This conditional is perfect for job application and working but I feel like I’m mimicking myself when it comes to emotion. I’m currently fearless, heartless, not confident but like I can do everything without stress. My previous version of me is depressed, also worried and feeling worthless, not confident and scared that bad things will happen. Also I used to press myself when things went bad or I made a mistake. 

My conclusion is that high nicotine makes me feel this way because when I stop smoking for a while my emotions become stronger. However this can be a state of my mind (mental problem) when things change. I realize that human action has great bounds with action and emotion can hold you back in different ways. For example, if you kill someone you may have somethings to pull you or hold you back like desire, anger, joy,..>< fear, scare, empathy,..( Which I don’t have now and the only hold me back is my mind, I can ensure that emotion does this better than mind). I think I slowly become something that people fear: heartless, fearless, unbound by morals; can do everything with no stress, no feeling, like a machine or like an unknown creature nothing like human.

 Do you think I should keep it up by continuing to smoke heavily ( a pack a day)? I think it is great with me compared to my previous life affected by strong emotion."
Why would someone cry out of sadness when someone tells them they are gorgeous and beautiful?,4,7,2025-09-08 07:38:10,"I mean, shouldn’t they be happy?"
All those advices for depression are trash,109,44,2025-09-08 07:28:05,"I hate hearing all the usual that people say to help heal from depression. Like I can list all the things that they usually say:

go to the gym/exercise

do yoga/meditate

go on a trip/travel

talk to friends and family

go to a professional

pray to God

hike and see nature

reflect and find solutions 

let go of all your thoughts/problems and start a new life 

The list goes on and on...

I've honestly tried doing some of those things and at the start it kinda made me feel better...but in a split second... boom....my life just gets depressing again

I honestly don't have hope anymore that my life will get better. And I think others just don't understand what people who are depressed are feeling. I envy people who are genuinely happy with their lives. Cus all I do right now is mask up that I'm in a state of despair. Making up a facade that I'm happy but deep down inside I'm just a lost human being tired of living in this world..."
Has anyone else lived a life with abuse everywhere and no safe person?,11,11,2025-09-08 07:14:50,"Has anyone else experienced abuse in every part of life home, school, college, friendships never having a safe person, not even once? I have grown up without loved ones no one to talk with hand out with someone who will love and care for me ... For me it was 21+ years of this, with six narcissistic family members at the center. I’d like to know if others have lived through something similar, so I don’t feel so alone. .. basically very lonely.. I don't know why I am still alive for more pain ...."
Birthday Blues is particularly bad this year.,3,5,2025-09-08 06:57:50,"Hi guys, this is my first time posting here, and I guess I just wanted to vent about this week. I guess the short of it is I have the ""Birthday Blues."" I didn't even know it had a name, but I guess it does. I usually get pretty depressed around my birthday (I have constant depressive episodes, it just flares up without fail this time of year)

I turn 21 this upcoming Saturday, and this year around it has been worse. Pretty much the last few weeks, I've been spiraling mentally, and even though I have what should be a good support system, a lot of the time my feelings get dismissed, so I don't tell anyone I know about it anymore.

  
I guess that's why I'm here, sharing it. Not sure where to go from here, I'm just hoping that I start to feel better because these thoughts can make it feel like I'm drowning. I should be proud I'm making it to 21, and I hope I believe that someday."
Paranoia - 😓,4,14,2025-09-08 06:51:58,"What should I do? I constantly feel like people are watching me. Not really like through windows or cameras, more like they can just somehow see me. If I think of someone, it feels like they’re watching me at that exact moment, not sitting at home on their phone or spying, just living their normal life but still able to see me. But I also sometimes get scared about cameras, especially in bathrooms or showers at other people’s houses. I’ll look around everywhere because I’m worried there might be hidden ones. Even when I’m on my phone, I’ll turn my face away because I’m scared people can see me through it. I check my social media like a million times a day just to make sure I didn’t accidentally post something. I also feel like people can read my thoughts, like I’m saying them out loud even when I’m not. I worry they can see what I’m doing on my phone and way more than that. I do go to therapy once a week, but not really for this. When I told my therapist I feel like people can see me even when no one’s there, they just said it’s part of social anxiety and it’s fine. But I’m not sure if it’s fine. I can’t really switch therapists right now so I’m stuck wondering if this is serious or if it’ll just go away. Also, I repeat to myself all the time that I’m crazy and imagining it, like a hundred times a day, just trying to convince myself it’s not real. This affects my normal life too because I get so embarrassed and scared that people are watching and judging me that I don’t even want to leave my room."
I don't know what to do and I'm scared,1,9,2025-09-08 06:51:49,"So I'll have to go to college soon but I'm really scared about it, I mean I hate my life here but I'm also really scared to start something new, genuinely I think I'm really scared to be alone and I'll have to meet new people and my head is like full anxiety, thinking about everything that could happen, I don't want to do it, I'm just tired of life everything is shit, I think I'll have to end it all I'm thinking about it and I'm too scared to do it but it feels like the last solution, people say that it will be okay, but what if not made to be okay, I mean I don't understand what's going on and I've been feeling bad my whole life, maybe its too late to be okay"
I’m a horrible person,3,3,2025-09-08 06:40:49,"(Warning: Longish rant. I really tried to keep this as short as I could.)

I put a facade every single day of my fucking life. I try to appear as normal as any other person could be; a loving daughter, a supportive friend, someone who rejoices in the achievement of other people’s goals. But deep down, I’m really fucking miserable.

I was diagnosed depression a couple of years ago. I’ve been on a job hunting spree for an entire year that has landed me nothing. It’s been a year and half since I dropped out of college because my grades were fucked and my financial aid was revoked, effectively disappointing my parents by fucking it up in the only thing I was good at. I’ve been stuck at home for that year and a half doing absolutely nothing and rotting away in my room. I watch the world rotate and people convert their entire lives while my mine has been stuck in a time loop. I manipulate people’s perception of me because I’m embarrassed of my entire existence, but I don’t know for how much longer I can keep this little circus act going.

I hate myself. I hate that I seethe when a friend tells me they’ve been doing good in their career, in their relationship, or in just any other stupid little aspect. I hate that as the only daughter, I’m a disappointment for my parents, who have given up everything for me. I don’t want to think and be like this, but it’s like there’s a voice in my subconscious that I can’t shut up no matter how hard I try to. At this point, the only thing keeping me alive is my fear of death, which is ironic because every single day I wake up wishing I didn’t."

For context, I’ve always been the person people come to for advice, for a shoulder to cry on, or for an ear just to listen. But I’ve caught myself no longer acting like I used to. I no longer show emotion during traumatic events. I’ve been to 3 funerals and have yet to cry at 1. At my sister’s wedding I couldn’t produce any true emotion. It felt forced when I smile and laugh. My pregnant wife recently broke down in tears when I came home and I found myself unable to calm her down and consolidate her.

I've had to deal with the deaths of two people in my life last year, my grandfather and my beloved pet cat, which sent me down a rabbithole of self isolation and depression. I've been having to deal with depression (which I've been prescribed fluvoxamine for between 2022 until late 2023) and anxiety (undiagnosed) since I was 15, but I've been suffering earlier than that. I've been getting worse since 2023 and I've got to a point where I can't even leave my home to do basic chores like grocery shopping or do something which should normally be relaxing such as going on for a walk because I'm afraid of what other people on the street will think of me. I've had nobody else to talk to for the past year or so besides my online friends who've been the only reason I haven't gone completely mental. I haven't had the opportunity to talk to another mental health expert for a year, and even then she was charging like 200 bucks (lei) a week for less than an hour of talk (we're short on money) It's not like I could just talk to anyone else, either, since I've been told before by my mom to just man up or that it's my fault for being this way and that I have to recover all by myself. I want to go to avoid any confrontations but I also don't want to have a heart attack on the street. Doing this partially just to vent. Hadn't had the best

How do you guys stay focused without burning out?🙂‍↕️,1,0,2025-09-08 05:58:51,"I’ve been struggling with focus big time. I’ll sit down to work and end up doomscrolling for an hour 🙃. Recently I’ve been experimenting with pairing Pomodoro sessions with mini “reset breaks” like guided breathing or affirmations.

I got the idea from this app called Noggn—it lays it out neatly—but honestly, I’m torn if it’s really worth \$9/month when a timer + free meditation videos could do the trick. Still, the structure does keep me on track better than when I try to do it solo.

Do you think apps help keep discipline?

P.S. If you’re ever in that “I’m going crazy alone” headspace, check my bio there’s a small mental health community link where people just rant and it actually feels nice to not feel isolated."

So if shortly - I don't have anything officially diagnosed, but i know i have it and always knew it. Is it still okay to tell about it my counselor? Can I use my mental health as an excuse for a bad grades due to being drained and overwhelmed no matter what time or class it is?
P.S I also do not care if he's going to tell my parents about it, they already know. What i need is to get some support and understanding from teachers and school in general.
So.. should i?"
My brother (30) has schizophrenia. My dad (62) doesn't care to help him. How can I (33) help my brother get the treatment he needs?,1,1,2025-09-08 05:21:45,"I can't help my brother and he won't help himself.  He has been on and off of drugs (meth, crack, benzos, etc.) for years. He used to suffer from drug-induced psychosis but it has now obviously progressed to schizophrenia. He refuses to take medication. He has been hospitalized multiple times due to his bipolar disorder. He's declining before my eyes, really just descending further into madness. I want to prevent him from declining even further but I don't know what to do. I want to help him have some semblance of a normal life and find peace. How can I get my brother help without his or my father's approval? My father's lack of education and denial mixed with my brother's unwillingness to get help has been crippling me. What do I tell my dad? I don't know how to reach him mentally. He just isn't taking my brother's mental health seriously. Thank you all in advance for your answers. I really need to be able to give my dad some insight from an unbiased source."
I don't know what the right job is for me - All my skills that were originally hobbies became exhausting when I tried to make money?,1,0,2025-09-08 05:15:26,"Hello friends. I have tried various different skills but I have not found the right job for me. In short, now I am a cybersecurity freelancer but I feel like I am bored doing it over and over again even though the income is quite good in my country if I get it every time. Before I dived into cybersecurity skills, I also tried other things such as web development, UI / UX, and design since high school and at first I enjoyed it as a hobby but when I made it all into a job or something that could make money like freelancing, I felt depressed and stressed because I didn't get the money then I got bored and burned out too, just like cybersecurity felt and now I have been burned out for 7 months because of this condition.  Oh yes, now I'm 20 and I'm the only child of my parents, maybe some of you will think I'm the most relaxed person in the world but honestly I want to earn my own money and don't want to depend on my parents all the time, anyway this thought has been there since I was in high school but what can I do in my country finding a job is hard even though on the other hand I've also tried to join several communities and volunteer to network but there is no information regarding vacancies, they said the jobs I've tried require years of experience to get in. This is very tiring for me that's why I jumped into freelancing. Btw, I've consulted my psychologist too and he said it's okay if you don't have passion and your work is what it is the most important thing is that you can enjoy life but unfortunately this advice is difficult to put into practice because of the obstacles as I mentioned before. I'm really devastated at the age of 20. What should I do? What advice can you give me?  

Please don't answer: 
1. Go to college: honestly, college doesn't help improve skills and jobs because connections here don't completely guarantee getting a job (based on my observations from people who graduated from college and are unemployed). 
2. Just relax, you're still young and have a lot of time: I don't mind relaxing, but at least I want to try and earn money."
What will happen if I call 988 and tell them this?,2,5,2025-09-08 05:13:03,"I've recently had some very serious, unhealthy thoughts. This is not me trying to elicit sympathy btw, so don't come at me, please😭. Anyways, I’m a 16yr old who carries stress from school, but mainly from my home life. Recently, it’s been too much to bear. I’ve thought to myself ‘When I get to my breaking point, I’m gonna take a rope to the park, call 988, and tell them I’m thinking about abandoning life.’ Can you guys give me a rundown of what you think will happen if I do this?"
Depression causing cognitive decline? Can it get better?,1,1,2025-09-08 04:06:41,"Can untreated depression, ADHD, autism, anxiety, and/or medication or alcohol overdose cause cognitive decline or memory impairment? 

I’m 20F known by a lot of people in one way or another to be forgetful, clumsy, ditsy, and stupid. I swear to people I used to be smart, the first semester of my senior year people sought me out for advice in calculus or chemistry, i tutored chemistry, got a perfect score on an english SOL, good/decent grades, but now I can barely remember to feed myself for the day. Since then I have failed community college classes numerous times, lost motivation for hobbies despite trying to get it back multiple times and just ending in frustration, and forgotten multiple important things/tasks/bits of information. Recently I’ve noticed it’s been hard to put into words simple concepts or remembering words for simple things. I feel like I’m constantly fighting with my brain to both work and to not work against me, and I’m tired of feeling like and being looked at like a ditzy helpless child. If I really am experiencing severe cognitive decline, does it/can it even ever get better? Or will I just have to constantly forcefully have tools in place?"
I just need a output,1,0,2025-09-08 04:31:14,"I am so sick of life, people, and everything in general

Life feels like an endless cycle and struggle not worth living through anymore to me but I don’t wanna off myself since my parents and siblings would have to live through the trauma of that while I have to wonder why I am so sad, if someone else was given my life they would be happy but I’m not and I don’t know anymore"
Everything feels fake,1,0,2025-09-08 05:04:42,"I'm not sure this is the right place to post this but I couldn't think of anywhere else. For context, I've recently graduated from university and have been searching for job since (who isn't these days). 

Anyways for the past year or two years, I began to notice or feel that nothing feels ""real"", like everyone is just pretending all the time. Walking through a city, I see people participating in charity walks or overhear small talk about a recent movie or whatever else. All of these interactions feel unreal to me. Like everyone is an NPC in a video game and nothing actually exists if that makes sense. I've gone to therapy in the past too and even that felt ""fake"", like every conversation was pre determined or something. I've found it hard to connect with family and friends who I've known for 10+ years for similar reasons. 

Hopefully some of that made sense and I'm curious if anyone else has felt something similar. Maybe it's just how the ""real world"" is when your academic life is over but yeah im not too sure."
My friends are still planning on staying in contact with my ex that sexually assaulted me,4,6,2025-09-08 05:04:38,"I was sexually assaulted by my ex partner last year while we were still living together after the breakup. I had been pretty quiet about it because I'm aware of the societal narrative of women not being believed, along with that he and I were in a couple heavy friend group and at the time I didn't want to put anyone in the middle and was uncomfortable as being seen as the bitter ex girlfriend. 

I finally revealed to a women in the group about the SA and she was honest that she had still been going to his gigs, but assured me she'd never discuss me with him and she knows she has issues with forgiving people easily. I reached out to another friend who I had suspected was still in contact with him and she had also been going to his gigs and asked if that was an issue (that friend knows that I've been having panic attacks and nightmare, regarding men since the breakup, but I haven’t outright told her about the SA). I'm deeply hurt by this revelation. 

A bit of background, the second friend who I'm closer with was emotionally cheated on by her husband 18 months ago and she chooses to stay with him and as a result our friend group cut social ties with affair partner, which I was happy to do because I saw how much that situation hurt her. As I found out about them still supporting my exs gigs, I kept thinking how'd would she feel if I picked a casual friendship with the affair partner. I know it would hurt her. 

A big part of the SA was coercive, so I'm pretty big on people having full automny to make descions freely. I'm just unsure how to navigate this situation because I don't want to force anyone's hand, but I think I'm justified in feeling put out about the whole situation. Or am I overreacting?"
losing my mind late at night,1,1,2025-09-08 04:41:29,"it's 5AM. I can't sleep because of one comment that was made earlier. still. every fucking time I try to keep composure and TRY TO HEAL. I didn't ask to be born this way. why the fuck am I still here? MY FAMILY DOESN'T RESPECT ME. I'm sorry for being depressed and physically ill and worthless. I'm sorry for being here.

I'm losing my mind. I don't know what I am. what even is this thing I'm doing right know? this is life and I'm actually living? I DIED YEARS AGO. nothing is ever real. I'm just an entity. why should I care? I hate that I care more than they'll ever know. self-harm doesn't bring me the joy it used to. I can't continue to live in mania. I can't forget I keep forgetting things I should remember I tell my mind she doesn't listen. it's so loud within this silence. I WISH I WERE A NORMAL FUNCTIONING HUMAN. fuck living. my mind, my thoughts, the words being said in my head I don't know what's real or not. I don't know why I think and feel when I don't work correctly anyways. my brain must be eating itself because my ability to think straight has gone out of the window. I want to say my emotions allow for this to happen but actually I'm dead inside and it's the opposite, I don't feel anything and care for nothing. I'm so empty I'm just trying to feel something."
When does thinking encroaches onto action?,1,2,2025-09-08 04:13:00,"I know l there doesn’t exist a clearly defined line where one crosses the thresholds of thinking into doing but if there is something that is definitive what is it?  

I am so tired of not knowing when it ends and when things will get better.   

Lost my father last year but have been feeling ‘dead inside’ for a long time prior and his death gives impetus to think more about it.  The idea is about the only thing that brings any hope to look forward to, if that makes sense.  The most troubling characteristic that I haven’t told anyone is that when I read stories about celebrities that took their life, I don’t feel sadness or pity for them but applaud them."
how do u get over it,1,5,2025-09-08 04:12:40,"im not sure how to explain it but there is this feeling that comes and goes in waves every few months no matter how well i am doing in life. 

i am a normal teenage girl on the outside. im moderately pretty, i go to the best school in my district thats ranked decently high in california, i have okay grades, and i have a job. i have mostly done all this by choice to keep myself from feeling like an outcast. but there is this inescapable feeling deep inside of me that i have felt since i was a child.

this summer this gigantic wave came over me, which is not completely crazy, it happens ever so often like maybe every two months, but this time it was horrible and made me feel so deeply nauseous and horrible and like a burden. i felt like i had lost everything. then i was broken up with, i stopped talking to friends and even blocked them to prevent even seeing messages on my phone, i deleted all my socials, and i just fell into this horrible cycle again but this time it is heavier than ive ever felt. i know im only 16, but its like the weight of the world has been on my shoulders for decades. 

i relapsed, self harming again, and fell back into bad eating habits. last week i got covid and wasnt able to leave the house for over a week, i couldnt even go to work. recently ive began falling back into suicidal thoughts, i repeatedly tell myself that i do not want to be here anymore and i want to be gone, i wanna go home even when i already am at home. i made things horrible for myself, i isolated myself, i lost my friends, and i am losing my ability to speak. 

i dont understand why this happens to me. i try over and over to pick myself back up. ive tried exercising, journaling, spending more time with my dog. i spent time with a friend today and i felt like all day i just ended up burdening her with my thoughts even though she has voiced that she is concerned for me. i dont understand why i feel so alone if there are people that think about me. this is the longest episode i have ever had, usually it is broken up between weeks where i feel okay one week and horrible the next. but now i just feel like this everyday, and i dont know how much longer i can handle it. it is this deep, painful, agonizing, and disgusting feeling i get deep inside of my chest and throat that it makes me nauseous. i am afraid of dying but i keep thinking about it. i think that everybody would be better off without me burdening them with these thoughts and feelings, it is so draining for me that i cannot imagine how badly i am draining other people by isolating myself. 

my friends are all 16 yr old girls that really honestly dont think about what others are going through, it is unintentional but i can see it in the way they act. i can tell they feel weird about me, they dont understand why i am being so distant, and they dont understand why their texts arent going through to my phone anymore. i feel so abnormal for being like this. i try to give them grace but recently i dont think i can feel bad for anybody else anymore. i dont see the selfishness in me, and it is not there to prevent me from ending it anymore. im aware ive become selfish, and i will be called selfish for doing it, but i dont think i can escape it anymore."
why do we do this to ourselves?,1,3,2025-09-08 04:11:33,"for quite a while now i’ve been in a really rough spot, just mentally exhausted and been trying to feel relief for over 2 years now, trying new medications, therapy, and just really trying to get myself in a better state of mind, but nothing has been working and i’m starting to lose hope.

one of my biggest questions I have is why do people continue living? what the point? we live in a world where mean-spirited rule the world, create problems for people and making the simple process of being alive hard. Like, why do i have to spend everyday of my life working a job just to be able to live my life? i love the planet and nature, so why do i have to waste my time looking for a job and working everyday? i already don’t want to be here, so why should i even work? i get why some people keep going, but i’ve gone through the reasons in my head and can’t find anything worth staying alive for that outweighs the amount of pain my brain has.  I really am looking for answers if anyone has something to share, but i’m not hopeful for the outcome either, cus what may be your reason to live probably doesn’t effect me in the same way."
What are the withdrawals of nicotine like? I’m thinking about quitting but I’m scared,1,4,2025-09-08 04:10:25,"Nicotine is like a gift from Heaven for me. I’ve never felt like a normal human being. I suffer from general anxiety disorder ever since I was 5. I was possibly diagnosed with autism but my mom got a second opinion from a different doctor because she “did not want an autistic child”. I can finally talk to people and be who I want to be. I don’t care about fitting in and I’m confident now and my body dymporhia has improved. My old Anti depressant has never worked this well for me. 

I’ve been vaping for almost 5 weeks now, and I’m at my second vape. It’s a 25K puff 5% nic RAZ vape. Before this, I’ve only hit a vape a couple times maybe three or two times as a social thing. When I don’t vape for like 2 or 3 hours, I get the WORST headaches, I get VERY tired, and SO angry. I also get really jittery. But apparently the withdrawal symptoms peak around 3 days. So does anybody have any personal stories or tips? Or how does the withdrawal process actually go like?"
I feel too overwhelmed to live,4,7,2025-09-08 04:09:05,"I’m 16 and I feel so overwhelmed with everything. Other than school, I have to learn how to drive (which I’m literally terrified of) and get a job. I’m a junior in high school and I feel so behind, everyone I know has jobs, can drive, and are planning for college or know what they’re doing after school. I don’t want to go to college but I’m really not good at anything so there’s not really a job I can think of that I can get into and make a living off of. I’ve felt suicidal for years, but now it really feels like the only option and it’s been sounding like a pretty snazzy deal. Everyone tells me it’ll get better and these are the best years of my life but I’ve never been more stressed and depressed and it’s just been getting worse every year."
Would my therapist have me hospitalized if I told her about my suicidal thoughts?,7,7,2025-09-08 04:04:34,"I have had varying degrees of suicidal thoughts for around 10 years now, and have been hospitalized once in the past over it. For a while I have considered myself as ""passively suicidal,"" but I'm starting to realize it may be worse than that. I have an exact method and plan laid out for if I ever decide to do it, but I don't currently have any intention of following through. I think about it several times a day. My main reason for not doing it is how it would affect my partner and family members. I would not go through with my plan unless I genuinely had no one left in my life that would be saddened by my death.
 
I feel it would be beneficial for me to discuss this because it is obviously very painful and difficult to live like this, but I don't want to be involuntarily hospitalized as it could cause me to lose my job on top of being very expensive. Besides my therapist, I don't feel like I have anyone else I can talk to that wouldn't either try to have me hospitalized or be extremely disturbed to find out how mentally unwell I am."
I feel like I’m mentally deranged/sick,4,5,2025-09-08 03:55:22,"Don’t know where else or who to ask but I’m mentally not ok I don’t know if I’m a narcissist a physcopath or just a shitty miserable evil person. This whole thing started when I was young and using the internet way too much at 13-15. A very unhealthy amount of porn which turned to curiosity and watching gore people getting decapitated people getting shot in the head people getting hacked up and skinned alive. Also got bullied a lot by scumbags online from 15 to now at 29 and that definitely did not help me. my behavior online isn’t normal I used to loudly scream racial and homophobic slurs at my game and get unbelievably mad which iv gotten under control now.
.i still cheat on certain games and have zero remorse for killing people with cheats or if I ruin their experience and being super toxic saying ez shitter after I kill someone even ìif I’m cheating iv openly told people to kill themself and I hope you die in a car fire. After killing people while cheating I find them again and make them watch me burn their stuff right in front of them"
"I read weird fanfic as a teen, I suffer from what is probably pocd (diagnosed), and I genuinely see no reason I deserve to live.",1,0,2025-09-07 22:45:59,"TW: Mentions of harmful kinks, pedophilia, suicide, and depression. Please do not read if any of these subjects might be triggering to you. I don't think anything I wrote is graphic but take care of yourself. 

From the ages of 13-16 I read some really violent and taboo fanfiction on ao3, some of it sexualized even though I refused to read any thing where it wasn't portrayed as wrong. I won't get into the specifics of what I read but I'm pretty certain its not the worse the site has to offer. When I was probably 13/14 I went down a rabbit hole of Forced Infantilization fanfictions (non-sexual in nature mostly because it being sexual grossed me out), but I did read a couple that were sexual in nature. At that point I asked myself if I found this attractive. I quickly panicked and decided I didn't and stopped reading about that kind of thing, I read plenty of other messed up stuff as well. I read explicit scenes of kids who were my age and older but still kids. I read about rape, abuse, etc. 

I never got off to any of the stuff, I was never reading it with the assumption that it was good or something that I'd want irl. I've given a lot of thought to why I read the stuff. Looking back I think it was a mention of morbid curiosity, ""thrill seeking"", and severe depression. I was pretty numb at the time and reading this kind of thing diffidently made me feel something. But ever since that thought I've been suffering from horrible intrusive thoughts about being a pedo and not realizing it. I've never found a kid attractive or actually wanted to harm anyone but I'm worried I secretly do and don't realize. Besides even if I haven't, I have had sexual thoughts, I've asked myself how would I get away with it. As if I'd ever do anything, let alone not turn myself fucking in if not commit suicide if it ever got to the point I genuinely considered it. But I will admit it doesn't always feel ego dystonic. I hope and pray its not real that it can't be real. 

But I wonder. God I wonder if its all fake. If Its not ocd which I've been diagnosed with. If I was into it.  I wonder if reading that kind of stuff makes me a bad person. I don't/can't live with it. I've already had to stay at the mental hospital once. Does reading about that kind of thing make me a bad person? Should I just kill myself in case? I don't want to live like this. I can't keep doing this. My mom would be destroyed, my cat needs me. I don't know what to do or what to think. God what should I do, other than talk to my therapist and do the same bullshit I've been doing."

I've done absolutely unforgivable things that I'm supposed to just bounce back from like nothing happened, but this time I can't! I can hold myself to a life where I don't feel guilty about ever harming anyone, but when is the harm put upon me enough to stop?? 

I was born Gay and POC and with severe mental health issues that literally NO ONE (barring literal schizophrenic patients) has had to deal with. Yet I'm CONSTANTLY bombarded with ""your parents sacrificed so much and love you so much just so you can live,"" honey I'm TWENTY YEARS OLD AND HAVE THOROUGHLY FUCKED UP SO MUCH OF MY LIFE!! 

I don't WANT to live like this anymore!! I can't change like you want me to, I don't feel like I'm presenting as myself when you want a masked/changed version of me. And no, that doesn't mean I'm abusive; but am I not allowed to be naturally temperamental?? At least I don't take shit out on other people like most men do, but since I have the biggest fucking target on my back I'm constantly living in shame over things most women/worser men would EASILY bounce back from!

I don't want to live in this brain anymore! In this body that's forced to present as perfect yet supposed to hide how broken I am. Who am I if not broken, and why am I not allowed to incorporate that into my personality the way *I* want to without risking fucking careers or friendships! I'm not even a painful nihilist that bogs down every positive situation, I keep every thought to myself or spiral online just so I don't go fucking batshit crazy! But apparently even THAT'S not enough to keep me from publicly embarrassing myself!!

I'm done! I may be 20, but I'll be damned if I'm forced to live till 30. I will not be guilted into living just because people in third world countries have it worse. I'm grateful for everything so much so that I know the privilege of getting to commit soupslide after a DECADE of having to ""work on myself"" to ""be better."" If I have the privilege to live in America with my smart brain and not be able to use it just because other people are more athletic/agile; and then not be able to exercise my free will based on MY autonomy; I don't want it!

i feel unwanted,1,0,2025-09-07 21:39:12,"i think im incapable of being loved. even with friendships, i feel like all my friends secretly hate me and it feels so awkward around them because they’re always acting so passive aggressively towards me. it hurts to see how they have such deep bonds and friendships with other people but never with me. 

especially with my parents, i feel like such a burden and disappointment to them. my brother is the golden child and i’ve always wondered if they could’ve had a happy family/marriage if i wasn’t there. i already know my mom hates me and always be telling me how “oh u think i want to live with u, i’m waiting for the day u move out” (stuff like that). but it really hurt when my parents got divorced and she told me how she didn’t want me to live with her and told me to go with my dad like always, but then said my dad probably didn’t even want me either. i hate how i was born this way, my mom hates me because im a reflection of my dad and my dad hates me because he sees his bad side in me. 

i don’t want to die, but i never wanted to live in the first place. my whole childhood and basically the rest of my life i didn’t think of committing as that big of a deal because i knew it wouldn’t make that much of an impact on anyone anyways. i just wonder if anyone could ever be capable of showing affection or really love me, because if even my own parents didn’t, who will?"

Feeling down after bday,2,1,2025-09-08 03:52:03,"So today was my bday and it didn't go great but I expected that. I knew she wasn't gonna try to do anything cause we don't have a good relationship, I wanted her to remember that I wanted to pierce my stomach but she didn't. She asked what I wanted to do and I brushed her off and I know that's on me but I just want her to try sometimes and she never does.

And the rest of the day I was in the basement. But then I'm getting blown up my phone with texts for my bday and it's great but I was feeling overstimulated or something cause I just wanted the day for myself. 

So after a day of no communication like usual, my mom makes dinner and brings home some marshmallow brownies. Whatever, thanks for the last minute attempt to do something. But then she's complaining that I left everything after eating which I didn't, I cleaned my dishes. I just walked off without cleaning the food cause my mom and sister were still eating.

So yeah the day ended up kinda sucking because now I just feel down. But I feel like I can't forgive her. I know it's on me for not communicating everything but when we do have conversations, I never walk away feeling good. And I feel selfish and ungrateful and rude when I act like this cause she does try a little but it feels performative and not out of a place of caring. Like I want to be happy with her and have someone to lean on but I can't even be happy with her. And I just realized she never even said happy birthday to me."

Am I just supposed to say ""Hey guess what. I tried to kill myself when I was 12. Then again at 13. Oh and I used to cut myself.""

He knows I have some struggles but I don't think he thinks its anywhere near the extent that it is to. I really don't want to worry him. I don't want him to think differently of me. I also don't know if I want someone to know the one part of me that no one knows. 

I want to tell him I used to struggle (and I still am). I want his help and guidance and comfort, I just don't know how to go about it."

I had depression my whole life..traumas..anxiety..panicing.. and pain and pain and pain.
I never loved myself and never will. I never been normal and i'll never live normal..at least  i know now i'm physically broken.
Depression alone made my life terrible..i can't sleep well or eat well or even workout..my body is broken and weak.

I remember once had anxiety attack and panic attack and i opened up to someone i trust and cried alot..i wish to this day i didn't do that. I will never ever ever cry infront of anyone ever again.

death was a scary topic to me..even though i survived it multiple times in my life..but i know there is no god and when i die there is nothing on the other side. 
This time it's different..i'm not afraid. I found it relieving that i can kill myself. I can end this pain whenever i want. It doesn't matter when but eventually i will. i know i wasn't meant to be alive.. I was even a mistake.

I didn't choose to be alive..i didn't choose to live horror and continue to live in this hell. But i'll choose the end. i'm a little hesitant but i know this is for the best. 

I feel so disconnected..my mind is numb. today i imagined killing myself alot..hopefully that day will come. That way i won't live in pain and shame.

I tried to make this short..i'm writing while feeling numb and tired."

I hate the way I look,1,2,2025-09-08 03:47:49,"Okay I’m 18 f I have a lot of insecurities like any other girl my age. I got bullied really bad as a kid by my friends and peers and what not, especially for my body and being to flat. This led me to buy butt pads on Amazon when I was about 14 and I’ve been wearing them everyday since. 
I also cake on makeup so much to the point people I’m close to haven’t seen me with out some kind of makeup on in years. I sleep in my makeup a lot of times because I hate looking at my natural face. I hate going online and seeing girls that naturally are pretty and don’t have to put in nearly as much effort as I do. 
Don’t get me wrong my efforts definitely work, nearly everyday someone will tell me I’m pretty, which I guess is the goal. But I just can’t help but hate myself and I am constantly striving to be perfect, and I’m hyper aware of my appearance. I really wish I didn’t care so much, but this has genuinely been taking over my life for years. I just wanna be comfortable in my body but it seems the only way I’ll ever be able to love myself is if I get plastic surgery or continue this cycle and act like nothings wrong. I truly hate being insecure abt the way I look because there is so much more to life, but as a young women it’s all I can think about . Any advice please share. Thank you"
"I'm so close to quitting I have 1 reason left. Tired of fixing my problems at the bottom of a bottle or smoking them out any advice?

My first relationship I ever had/felt ended with me getting cheated on and I'll remember it like it was yesterday. My last relationship I just got through I was getting cheated on for 2 months and the worst part is I believed her lies until the truth was right in my face. After that everything has just felt like defeat... Obviously I'll get back on my feet because I refuse to quit and give up but am I destined to be by myself till death? I have my dog and one friend growing up, I've basically lost every other friend because they got married or our views stopped aligning and the only other friend I always had was my brother and he committed suicide when I was 7. I wanna give up from all this but I've seen what it puts others through and I don't feel like I'm someone capable of doing that to my family.

Compartmentalised,1,0,2025-09-07 20:36:06,"I have this unhealthy habit and I've been shutting down recently because I feel my problems have become too big to talk about. It feels sinister, like I just shut down. I can't even begin to talk about my problems to people I know. I end up feeling guilty because I feel like a burden. I think my grandad is the only one who has noticed because he's lost two brothers from suicide and every time he sees me he keeps saying keep your thoughts happy. It's been a recent thing. I do not intend on causing myself harm. But depression runs in the family and I just noticed he keeps saying this to me the last few times we met.

This is all I have. To write it down and hope a kind stranger reads it. I'm just feeling almost like an orphan. It will sound ungrateful. But my dad who I travelled to meet after he left us twenty years ago and made no contact. We met for three days and he talked all about himself. He has sent about two messages since (this was in April) I'm holding on to this relationship but it feels so broken. I feel broken from it. It was so surreal meeting him it almost feels like it didn't happen. Like a dream.
And my mom is an alcoholic. It is really bad she is sinking more and more into depression. Nothing I say or do helps her. I feel no one else in the family sees it as much as they aren't living with her."
I am your reminder of hope and of strength,1,0,2025-09-07 20:13:17,"I know there are a lot of us who need to hear this, perhaps all of us at sometime in this weird funny thing called life.
We all have our stories. And whether it's inherently good or bad, of hope or of despair, frightening, dark, of passion or madness; it's a matter of perspective.
Despite what might be thrown at us, We hold some power in writing our story, or at least shaping it.
We are all humans. Flawed. We have feelings and thoughts. We make mistakes. And it's all only a part of being human.
I believe that you are truly beautiful and you can't change my mind.
If you think you're unloved, I can say that there's someone out there in this world who truly loves you. And that someone might aswell be you.

Hang in there, and move when you can.
Ah! there's this song, After the Storm by kali uchis & Tyler, the creator. A lyric- ""if you need a hero, just look in the mirror, no one's gonna save you now, so you better save yourself."" Another- ""I know it's hard but do you even really try?""

Now, for all my suicidal folks– I have a story too. And after all these years of wanting to cease my existence and end this suffering, I have noticed something recently. I might not have all the answers to all the questions of life and the morality of suicide; also, what a funny and weird thing to expect one to know it all! I have observed that my body goes into a fight or flight response when I make myself face death, through suicide ofc. And as a trauma survivor, it seems to me I am abusing myself. I don't need to be threatened right now that someone's going to kill me, even if it's supposedly for my relief. It's against my biology. My brain is inherently wired to want to survive. I need to be loved, I need to be held.

Medication resistant,1,3,2025-09-08 03:42:53,"Looking to see if anyone in a similar situation in their 30s - 40s and proven to be medication resistant after trying tons of different medications for depression and anxiety has any advice if you found any alternative kinds of treatment helpful at all?

Psychedelics have been a little tricky for me some have helped a bit in the past others send me into a panic attack. I also tried TMS therapy with zero improvement.
I did a test from GeneSight which proved I am medication resistant so really not looking for any more suggestions on medication.

Any advice from other people in a similar situation? Alternative kinds of treatment or life habits that work for you? I’m so tired from trying.. I’m ready to just accept this is just how life will be and nothing will get better"
I've lost my sense of purpose,1,0,2025-09-07 19:39:24,"I feel like I have no real reason to continue living, but I also don't necessarily want to die. It's like I'm in this weird state of feeling ""nothing"" all the time. I'm sick of school, my classes are all super interesting and I love learning, but it's turned into so much busy work and I'm just losing the drive I had to care any more. My whole life my mom has pressured me into being ahead or setting myself up for college, but now that I'm almost to the ""college stage"" of my life I'm realizing that I don't care enough about anything to dedicate that much energy and effort toward something. I don't mind my job, but I'm working with people so much older than me so everything feels so awkward all the time. I feel like every part of my life is trying to be in a different stage than I'm ready for, but I have no time to actually prep myself to get ready for anything.



I love traveling and learning new cultures and languages, I'm currently working towards trying to get into a school in another country to see if a new life is all I need. The sucky thing is I really don't even know where to start with that process though, do I need an agency or can I just apply and go on a visa.. no matter who I ask in my life everyone just brushes it off as if it's too difficult to figure out. In all honesty I just feel no sense of home here. If I didn't have my cat I don't think I'd be coasting as well as I am. Nobody in my family cares to listen to me well enough to understand how lost I feel, everyone just says ""lifes a bitch and then you die"" but that doesn't make me want to chug along until I find a happy moment, that just makes me want to die. But I don't want to die, I do truly believe that there's something out there that will make me feel like I mean something, I just have no idea where that thing could actually be. It's like I'm in this weird emotionally neutral state where my heart wants to keep pushing to find what purpose I have in my life, but my mind has no idea where to begin that journey and is ready to give up with trying to find the starting line."
I'm really confused,2,4,2025-09-08 03:41:02,"Sorry if this is a long rambly post. It just happened and I feel overwhelmed.

Just for some background info. I'm 14, turning 15 in October, in 10th grade, and I'm a guy, if that helps you understand anything.

Today I cried the hardest I ever had in my whole life. I'm shocked because I don't even know why. Grades? Friends? No idea. I've never felt this in my life. Last year I've noticed some insecurities popping up like my looks, my grades, etc. Over time, these insecurities made me feel worse and worse about myself. Eventually, I flat out hated myself. I only had one hobby and that was math, and everyone called me a nerd for it so that's totally helpful. Today and last week was when things got as bad as they could be. I felt this really terrible sadness most of the week. I went out with my girlfriend today and she noticed that I wasn't feeling well. She asked me why but I couldn't tell her because I didn't know. I ended up just shedding tears on the spot, I had to hold in crying. I didn't know why. Later on I went home early and I called with her instead, and (this is what just happened) I went on my bed and just started uncontrollably crying.

The reason may be something like I'm insecure about my looks, my grades, and I feel I'm not enough generally. A second part may be because no one wants to be friends with me, like I'm not noticed, but that doesnt feel like a problem to me. But I don't feel like it's any of these. It may be a little bit of everything.

My mom and my girlfriend is worried about me, they said I should try counseling or therapy (not sure if there's a difference). I declined, but I'm not sure if that's a bad decision.

I know my problem may not be as bad as others on here, but I just wish that I could have some help.

What should I do? I really don't want to have a whole crying fit tomorrow and the day after. I'm comfortable enough to answer questions. I just need to know what I should do."
Fed up with the “help”,1,0,2025-09-08 03:39:36,"So I have a few things stacked against me.  

ADHD
Likely autistic. No diagnosis
PTSD from Iraq
Childhood issues

I join these motivational groups. Self help things. I keep seeing this saying no one is coming to save you. I’m fucking 44 years old. It’s very apparent I’m alone. I also have never asked anyone for help. The shit gets old. 

They assume that I just have the ability to end everything that I suffer from. Sorry I’m not built like you. Fuck off. It isn’t helpful.  It just gets old. 

I go to the doctor to get drugs and they have the opposite effects on me. The mental health people act as if this is incredulous. 

I’m tired of fighting for everything. I’m tired of a today for tomorrow. I’m just supposed to believe everything will be ok. It isn’t ok. That’s the problem."
Can this intractable problem be solved?,1,3,2025-09-08 03:36:27,"To make short of long, I will divide it into 3 parts.
     As I go to school, no matter how I finish it greatly, there was always a sound alarming, ""It isn't enough, so you need to pay more effort."" Regardless of my tiredness , finally I would and had already been unable to restart my school life.
     As I stay at home, I felt relaxed at first, but the very next moment, the anxiety came. It told me which I had the talent for learning, and it wasn't the time I gave up, otherwise I couldn't rely on my family forever. So I also felt terrible.
     What about change my mindset while going to school? It's almost impossible, because both of my willings to work hard and to relax enough are making me anxious. I can't even solve them separately no matter they come together.
     Mean while, I have asked for help from nearly all the ones I can, and have got lots of solutions. But desperately, none of those helps. So I follow my close friend's opinion, come here and ask if any brilliant, sapiential and kind-hearted one can help me."
What’s wrong with me ?,1,1,2025-09-08 03:34:49,"Hello everyone, I don’t know why I’m writing all this but I think I need a place where I could have clear answers about my person. I am now 18 years old for a month And I realise that I hate myself. I don’t know if it can be related to a mental disorder but very often, I have an indescribable rage against myself, I want to tear off my skin and for a while I burned myself with a lighter. I have long put it back on the fact that I am surely complex on my personality in the same way that a person would complex on his physique but now that the time, I wonder if I don’t have a serious problem.

how to help a depressed sibling?,1,0,2025-09-07 15:29:33,"I (20) recently found out that my younger sibling (15, let's call them A) is pretty severely depressed. They've expressed thoughts about self-harm and suicide, and I'm really concerned. They're under a lot of academic/extracurricular pressure, and all their internet activity is strictly monitored, so they don't have that outlet. On top of that, they're also closeted and dysphoric. Our parents know about this and have not taken any steps to help A (other than try and talk the trans out of them). They're also pretty controlling in general, and any therapy/mental health help that they know about is likely to be ineffective.

I was in almost the exact same position when I was A's age, except that our parents were a bit less harsh on me (mostly since I tried to appease them whenever possible. A can be very stubborn and pushes back a lot, which makes the situation worse). I still struggle a lot with depressive/suicidal thoughts and disassociation. All this is to say that I am fairly confident I can understand most, if not all, of what A is going through right now. I'm going back to college soon, though, and am just really worried/guilty about leaving A in this situation alone.

I am planning to talk to A about their mental health as soon as I find a safe time to do so, but I'm really not sure how to approach it. The thing is, we are not really close. We have a 5-year age gap, and both have tendencies to withdraw and self-isolate. We don't really text/call while I am at college, either. We don't really talk about our feelings, and they've been pretty withdrawn lately. I also didn't find out about A's mental health from A themself - my parents found out from a third party a while back, and I stumbled across the documentation they had by accident. So bringing this up will not only bring up those memories, but also potentially violate A's trust from the start, if they even trust me in the first place.

I'm afraid that if I take the wrong tack, A will just clam up and lie (it's what I would do (and have done) in their situation), and their trust in me will be broken. I also don't really know how to help if they do choose to open up. A's communications are monitored, so it's not like we can text freely while I'm away. I'm financially dependent, so I can't get them into therapy or other professional help without giving away the ""everything is normal"" act.

Thanks for reading this. I really appreciate any advice you can give on this situation?"
"Is there something wrong with me? Tw: $h, homicidal ideation and suicide etc.",1,0,2025-09-07 15:08:02,"So from the age of 11 I think, I experienced violent thoughts, cannibalism, killing others and having what others would call intrusive thoughts even tho I enjoy them to a degree. A few years ago I started taking antidepressants and antipsychotics, it stopped for a while but I stopped taking them for a while and now I feel like I have periods of time where I get very violent, I want to hurt my loved ones and do things to them I won’t describe here. I also have fantasy’s of being restrained by the police in front of others, or committing a suicide so others would see. I crave attention, also when I have those episodes I like self harming for fun not because I’m sad or anything I just do it for fun. I also switch between being super happy and severely depressed. I mostly am in a state of numbness where I don’t care if I live or die. I am not diagnosed with anything except ADHD, I have never been worried about it until my boyfriend told me to get help because it’s not normal. Since I stopped taking the medication it started to become more frequent and voice in my head (these are my thoughts I can’t control) started telling me to eat my boyfriend, and do things to him. I recently acted on those urges and did something that hurt him, he said he doesn’t want to know me anymore if I don’t get help. If love to get feedback on my thoughts and feeling sorry if it’s messy. I already posted this on other communities."
My sister started meds yesterday. Why shouldn’t I? I’m confused.,1,0,2025-09-07 14:01:20,"My parents passed two years apart, my mom 2022 and my dad 2024. Both had ugly diseases that made us react to so many hospitalizations, I lost count of how many. 

I have been very sad obviously, but I got married in 2023 and that helped a little. I have the most wonderful loving husband I could ask for. Still, I’ve been feeling either numb or in so much pain. I tried several psychologists but I felt none of them were actually helping me so I just stopped trying.

Also, I don’t talk a lot about feeling depressed. I feel it is a very personal thing. Also, my husband is also dealing with his mom depression so I want to be a safe space for him, not another burden. I have an autoimmune disease (a type of arthritis) so I complain enough.

My sister on the other hand has been telling me that she is depressed for the last two months. Her boyfriend is shitty and she is a medical doctor so she stakes awake every four days doing shifts. She was having sleepless nights and waking up as nothing happened. She has been crying a lot as well. So she went with the psychiatrist and the guy immediately medicated her (xanax and rivotril).

I haven’t gone go the psychiatrist because I don’t want to take yet another medication (i have biological meds every other week for the arthritis). Also, i have been so disappointed by the psychologists that I don’t see the point. 

I am able to work (I bury myself with work in fact). I feel numb even with happy things. And also very tired. I fantasize about suicide a bit, but then I look at my husband and cats and feel it is worth staying, even in the numbness.

Should I be on meds? Why does it say about me as a daughter that my sister is needing meds and I am not on them? Please don’t judge, I am honestly just confused.

Thanks for reading all this."
Abuse follows me,1,0,2025-09-07 13:52:10,"When I lived with my mum I was abused, when I stayed at my dad's house I was abused. I spent the first nine years of my life living with my mum, then I was FINALLY taken away from her despite social services (cps) being involved in my life since I was like seven. I was placed in the care of my grandfather and his wife, but the abuse followed me there too. Nothing physical, but every day I was screamed at or called something awful by my grandfather. I was a poorly behaved kid with anger issues, but like no wonder, my mother was a psychopath. Kids learn behaviours, no kid is born evil, but my grandfather seemed to believe I was born evil and thus treated me as such.

I am 24 now and he still calls me horrible things. Mostly 'psycho bitch', 'crazy bitch', 'bitch', 'bastard', 'useless cunt'. Stuff like that. I want to run away and leave my whole family behind but I don't know how to go about it. I have a job that I can't afford to quit and he knows where I work so I know he'd come to my workplace and confront me if I left.

I did leave before a few years ago and ended up being taken advantage of, so even if I did leave the abuse would probably still follow me. I am older but don't feel any wiser now, and women of all ages get taken advantage of so it probably wouldn't matter any that I am older.

I'm so sad with my life and how I have lived it. I wish my mother had killed me when I was an infant."
unstructured vent/rant,1,0,2025-09-07 10:59:21,"honestly i’m crying right now and my heart hurts so this is gonna be random it might not make sense idk but i just need to get shit off my chest kinda

When i feel suicidal I search on tiktok for people who have lost someone to suicide and that gives me enough strength to not commit to it, like seeing them grieving and missing the person who died fills me with empathy and i wouldn’t want to put my family/friends in that position but it doesn’t work anymore, like seeing those videos doesn’t upset me now.

I relapsed lastnight and a few weeks ago i failed an attempt. When i tried to kms i didn’t think about anyone, i just saw the opportunity and took it

I guess afterwards once i told people seeing their reactions made me feel kinda bad and i did cry a little but whenever i feel suicidal i don’t think about anyone else at all and once i feel okay again the fact i didn’t think about the people who love me consumes me with guilt,

i know if im suicidal and feel comfortable enough i will kill myself and i don’t want that. i don’t wanna leave the people who care about me, i don’t even wanna die i just want a break from everything that happens in my head

i just wanna be free from all the shit that happens in my head my head always feels so full and it gives me headaches and my eyes hurt me i see things a lot i guess and it can be hard to differentiate if it’s real or not idk i just hope things get better and i hope i dont kill muself in the meantime ahhaahahah. 🥹✌️ yeah anyways idek where im going with this but yeah"

I don't understand what went wrong.,1,5,2025-09-08 03:14:59,"I (27, m) met a girl (25) on a dating app and we hit it off pretty well. After a few very fun dates I tried to initiate something, but she said she wanted to take it slow, which of course is fine. We still were texting everyday and meeting up 3-4 times a week. After a few weeks I asked her about it again, and she gave me another indicisive no, which of course bummed me out a day or two, but I quickly realised that I was absolutely fine just having her as a friend as well, and I moved on from the idea. 

Now the problem: The second time I asked her about a relationship was the last time I saw her. Due to some unfortunate scheduling we weren't in the city at the same times for \~4 weeks after that. For the first week, we were just texting normally everyday, then she told me she was going to reduce her phone time while she was at her parents' and would not be as responsive. No problem so far. It was around that time that I realised I had gotten pretty dependend on that relationship because during that time of little contact, I started feeling worse and worse (not her fault at all, of course), which is why I finally decided seeking therapy then. 

Anyway, I tried to reach out to her a few times over the course of the next weeks, but she always told me she was too busy with her new job. No attempt to find a compromise, no further conversation, nothing from her side. It made me feel worse and worse every week. At some point I explained to her that I'm struggling, and why, and I asked her to help me understand. She explained that she had struggled with her mental health as well and now with the new job it was just a lot, and that she needed her limited free time to herself, and that she'd reach out t me when things are better. I immediately felt better. Not because she was struggling, of course, but because I finally felt like I understood. 

I also asked her about an upcoming festival: one of the things that connected us was our passion for music. I had a ticket, but I wasn't sure I wanted to go. I knew her favorite artist was playing, so there was a decent chance she was going, and that would actually be really important for my decision to go. Since I felt better and she wasn't going, I decided to go. BIG mistake, because guess who I saw there with a friend of hers. 

That day I had a nervous breakdown and went home. I asked her about it the next day. She spontaneously went because her friend had a ticket available. That's of course perfectly fine, but I asked her why she wouldn't tell me. Her response was ""I didn't think it was such a big deal"". That one nearly killed me after I opened up to her about my struggles. And it opens up other questions about that conversation that originally had made me feel better: If she really still cared about me, like she said, and the only reasons why we weren't in contact anymore were her lack of time and need for time to herself, why wouldn't she let me know she was on the festival? She knew we were both there, and she didn't have time to herself anyway, because she went with a friend. So those reason don't work here, which makes me doubt them alltogether. So now I'm back to constantly thinking about the time we had together and what went wrong, and why she wouldn't tell me the (whole) truth."
Sleeping issues feeling paranoid,2,2,2025-09-08 03:08:58,"These past few weeks I’ve been experiencing this extreme paranoia at night especially since I’m home alone until the morning,it’s really embarrassing because I’m old enough to know nothing is going to get me but I’m still extremely stressed at night to the point I can’t sleep….like right now I’m so uneasy and stressed I’m pulling at my skin…idk what to do I can’t live like this for the rest of my life."
I cannot feel like a normal person and i don't hate it.,1,1,2025-09-08 03:00:21,"I don't want to go into details about my life but i had a pretty shitty childhood with many horrible things that happened.

Recently i started to open more to people around me and telling them about thing that happened to me. However, i don't feel bad about them(?) like, i know the things that happened to me are pretty bad but i just like ""hahahah yeah that happened lol"". I can't feel bad about it. Is it just my brain's way of processing things? A few weeks ago i also ended up a 11 years old friendship and after feeling bad about it for two days, I don't care anymore about it happening. 

The issue is also that it happens with everything, I don't feel bad about seeing the horrible things that happen in the world. It's not a ""hahaha I'm edgy i don't care"" thing, it's more of i CAN'T care about it thing (This also goes for things like Gore, it doesn't affect me in any way). This sucks because I'm also forced many times to pretend to care. There are a few exceptions, and those are animal violence and things that happen to certain people i know.

As the title says, i would've like- wanted to pretend i actually feel bad about not caring but I don't."
literally down to my last straw,2,4,2025-09-08 02:50:06,"over these past few weeks all my nost horrible thoughts have been coming back. i thought i gotten past all my mental issues after middle school,but now im going into junior year and everything is coming back and hitting like a freight train. none of my friends hangout with me and i just feel like an inconvenience more than ever. ive stopped eating and now barely eat simply because i feel like i don't deserve it. im only happy at all when im on something and im almost out of stuff for the next two weeks already. i just cant take it at all anymore and my only reason im not killing myself is my best friend who doesnt even hangout with me anymore because she has a boyfriend now. i just feel like ill never be comfortable in my body,ill never like myself,ill never be worth anything etc etc. and i also hate that im so aware pf everything. i generally hate myself and everything about me as a person. i have always just pushed these thoughts away and away because i've never had a good experience with a therapist."
"The voices in my head claimed to be real, but I challenged them and won.",3,0,2025-09-08 02:44:20,"I suddenly started hearing voices about 4 months ago, and it has gone non stop since the day it started.
About 3 voices at a time, critical of every thought or action, mocking the things I think of, or how I do something.  
They also threaten my life, and claim to be some powerful shady entity,-common sounding stuff.

I play with the voices.
I think up little traps, or find logic flaws, and make them say things and argue with each other.

Some questions I ask that helped determine their authenticity.

1:  Okay, if you are really from (Some place) Tell me the 4 largest cities.

2:  Without me looking at a clock, I ask them to tell me the time

3: Tell me Pi to the 9th digit, you have all day and you can Google the answer if you want.

Things I myself do not know.
I demand answers to those questions, and they fail every time.

I found thaf doing this was empowering, giving me a solid grounding to work from. 

I hope these ideas help in challenging your voices as well."
My job is impacting my metal health,1,0,2025-09-08 02:42:33,"So a bit of background, I picked up a night job a few months back in a hotel. I've looked for night work for ages due to being a night owl and slightly anti social, moving away from busy kitchens etc it was a nice break. Problem being now, I've been working on my own every shift, which is part of the job, fine, but my anxiety etc is taking a massive hit. I don't know if it's the being on my own which wasn't really an issue until the last 4 weeks or so, or if it's the whole thing, unsocial hours followed by losing the day sleeping ready for the next shift. I don't know but it's taking its toll on me. I'm stuck on what to do, the logical side of my brain is telling me stick it out until you find a day job it'd be irresponsible financially to just drop and leave, but then the way I'm feeling I really don't know how much more I can do. I've been applying for day jobs the last week or so but tonight is the worst it's been and I don't know what to do. Any advice is more than welcome."

How to get over constant fear and paranoia due to unstable childhood,2,0,2025-09-08 02:35:29,"My childhood was very unstable and even now that I have turned 18 I still fear extreme anxiety and fear of basically everything. For me it’s always “my safety net could disappear anytime” so I try to cope by over complicating everything to make sure I don’t “get in trouble”. My whole childhood and teenage years could be summed with domestic abuse, immigration, discrimination, divorce, guilt, panic attacks. Even in the simplest things and situations I’m scared. it’s like every few months my brain finds new things to give me dread about sometimes it’s about getting falsely jailed, deported, taxes idk literally anything u can think of. Anytime a new opportunity comes I think of 20 more problems related to it. At this point I’m starting to think I have OCD or smth. I had my first panic attack when I was 15 heck i literally had one a few months at the absolute fear of failing my drivers test. I cannot live like this I just want to live like the kids around me. How do u cope when ur brain is constantly in fight or flight mode. I’m scared of taking every chance that comes my way cuz I’m so terrified of being scared and anxious of any problems that may arise. I don’t even remember when I have felt a feeling of content since I was 12. Sometimes my life seems so normal and it feels like I’m getting back on track but when I go down one of my anxiety episodes again it just feels like I never left. I wanna live a carefree and whimsical life. My dream is to just be happy and in peace. Anyone have a guide on how to live cuz I really need it"
Why can't my mind shut up?,1,2,2025-09-08 02:31:49,"It wants so many things. It wants to be hurt, it wants to be acknowledged, it wants attention, it wants pleasure. It wants my friends to do specific things to make me feel like they aren't hating me behind my back, it wants my friends to pity me, it wants my teachers to praise me. It wants to do everything I don't want or need, and my body follows suit. I know it's my fault that I can't discipline my own mind, which makes it even worse. It reflects horribly on how I am as a person, unable to control my own disgusting behaviors and thoughts, I hate it, I can't afford anything that'll help make it stop. I'd do anything to make it stop. Why do I want so much? Why am I not happy with what I have now?"
so lonely and i dont know what to do anymore (19),2,0,2025-09-08 02:27:08,"I’d like to start by saying coming here is seriously a final resort because I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this.

Recently I came out as trans to my parents and friends, this has been extremely stressful for me but is not the primary issue. When coming out, I unfortunately had to cut some people off (I had 4 friends before, now I have 1). I have extreme attachment issues and this was very hard to me, as one of the people I cut off was my friend of 7 years. I do not regret this but i also do? I also recently quit my job to focus on my transition. 

Right now I am extremely attached to my one remaining friend, who I have known for about 4 years, and fear I will lose them. I have no idea how to make more friends and they live quite far away so its unreasonable for me to see them daily. 

I really crave genuine human connection and every night i put myself in a pit and blame myself for things/ imagine the worst will happen. My attachment problems are so bad i do not believe i would be able to form a connection online, despite the fact i have considered it- moreover, i actually refuse to for this reason despite the fact it may seem contradictory, please just understand i only want physical connection.

With no job (and quite a toxic mother of whom i share a house with), I have become somewhat agoraphobic despite wanting to make friends. On top of this, i have no idea how i even can. 

It breaks my heart because i have always had problems with my attachment since childhood. I genuinely feel like no one can love as strongly as i do, i love my one friend more than anything in the world, but i dont want to put that much pressure on them all the time; i want the same connection back but i cant expect it because i understand the level at which i love could be considered unreasonable; i WOULD die for them.

I have a love-hate relationship with my attachment style; i love loving this much, but i hate how it shrivels me into nothing. I wish i could love deeply while still being able to care for myself.

At my 3 previous jobs (all failed), i did not manage to make one friend. i genuinely believe this is the reason i have been failing at every job i score, i hate being alone, and i feel alone all the time.

Please someone help. im really on my final straw here. im doing fine right now but i know the feelings will come back stronger; they always do.

I feel like i might just be wired this way.

Note: I have been going to therapy for the past year, i feel better for a little bit after therapy but everything just comes back. Im also on sertraline (100mg) for anxiety"
Lost my health insurance for a month and have to taper down my anti-psychotics,8,4,2025-09-08 02:21:43,"I have a schizophrenia adjacent mental illness (delusional disorder of the persecutory type). At my worst, I thought I was receiving psychic communications from human and non-human entities, couldn't hold a job, got kicked out of the house by my wife, and was super paranoid (thinking the government is watching me very closely and people in my life are monitoring me etc). For the last few years, I have had a medication that works for me at even a fairly low dosage and have kind of gotten my shit together.

Back when I wasn't working, we qualified for medi-cal and even though we've made a little bit too much for a family of four for the last couple years, they didn't kick us off. They must be tightening down becuase they booted me off without warning. It might be a couple weeks without my medication and I am a little bit worried that I will loose my grip on things and take half a year to get it back.

There was a schizophrenic (or similar) guy who came into my work last week thinking that someone had sabotoged his transportation and was talking about being the scion of King David and mumbling a bunch of psuedo-religious magical stuff. It hit a little bit too close to home and was just a little bit too close for comfort. I am going to see if I can't get meds before new health insurance kicks in. But for family and treatment, I might be out there weirding people out too."

I dont know what's going on anymore. All of a sudden I feel clueless and dumb. I find myself losing touch with myself and reality. 

I hope this goes away by tonight. 

Maybe something I ate? Maybe work related? I don't know. All I know is that I don't like this feeling. Is my mind trying to warn me of something?

Anyways, its been months since this happened and when it happened, it was bad for 2 whole days but it was still there for about a week. Since then, it would come and go but recently its been every night. I hate taking medication but I decided to take Alprazolam .25mg when I need it. Ive been having to take it every night though and upped my dose to .5 mg. I feel like I need to keep increasing it but I really really dont want to rely on medication like that. Once I started taking it every night, I tried all sorts of things to see if I wint get that paranoid feeling at night. Ive tried exercise, it didnt work. I tried meditating, it didnt work. I have hobbies i do right before bed until I feel tired but that feeling is always there. Nothing helps but this medication but only if I keep increasing my dose. Idk what to do anymore. Idk wtf is wrong me bc I dont want to live like this. I used to think my anxiety was bad but this only makes me feel like it wasn't even that bad then"

Why do I do things I don't want to?,1,0,2025-09-08 01:57:54,"There are times, be it because of anxiety, stress or paranoia that I do/act/behave in ways I don't want to (like self-harming, acting passive-aggresively towards other people, shut down and feel unable to answer, isolating myself from others)

It's not ~always~ that I dissociate (though it has happened sometimes goo and remember nothing of that period of time) but rather that I ""get triggered"" by something and I do something I don't want to while perfectly conscious of it and that I don't want to do x or that I should stop or change behaviour but I can't or it's really difficult.

It feels as if someone else were physically forcing me to or feeling like I'm in the backseat while my body does whatever.

I have been for around 6-7 years diagnosed whit schizoaffective disorder (cluster A, recently evolving to cluster B, my psychiatrist explained to me what that meant but right now I can't concentrate to remember).

I have also been recently diagnosed with mixed depressive-anxiety dissorder and been given venlafaxine (Effexor), which I have to take daily although sometimes I forget about taking it for unregular periods of time (sometimes a single day, sometimes a couple, sometimes more).

I ask here on Reddit on a throwaway account because I no longer see mental health professional for external reasons, I'm currently awaiting and appointment with a new one on my country's public healthcare service and the date is still months away and I feel the need to ask someone and think maybe here I can find anyone with any clue as to why this happens.

How to Multi-Task Again?,1,0,2025-09-08 01:57:22,"I used to be the multi-tasking queen. I could manage everything all the time all at once. I'm at the point now where I can barely multi-task. 

Back story: I've been doing more and more work on myself and my mental health over the last 5 years. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Depression. I started going to therapy 2 months ago (went regularly previously, but just got back into it). My job of 10 years is fast paced and constant with almost no breaks. I literally eat while working most days. I'm always tired. My two days off are spent catching up with my husband, friends, and family and running necessary errands. It's hard to find much of any time for myself without falling behind on something. I'm trying to restructure my system so my husband can help me more and starting in October I'm switching to 4 longer work days with 3 days off. I literally can't afford to work less hours. 

Does anyone have advice for how to improve my multi-tasking skill I've lost? It's getting bad enough that today I forgot where I was going while driving because I started telling my husband about a video I saw online. 😅 General advice on anxiety, life, etc is always welcome too."
Everyone judges,1,0,2025-09-08 01:56:36,"It is very hard for me right now, I think im falling into paranoia, every questions me, judges me for everything I like or say.

Funding it hard to love,1,0,2025-09-08 01:38:49,Ive been trying on and off to getting into dating but it feels so overwhelming. My low self esteem doesnt help amd dating sites just make me feel worse about myself. Im very average in basically every aspect which feels like it makes me less than in most situations. Like if I was above or below at least id be unique in someway but instead im no different than everyone else. I also have body dysmorphia and confidence issues do to the few past relationships ive had. Ive tried to make myself unique but it doesnt seem to help. I dont want to spend my entire life alone but I find it hard to love myself enough to have any amount of confidence and find it hard to have any kimd of emotion in relationships because of past trauma. I dont know. Feels like the more I try less confidence i have. But like I said I domt want to spend my entire life alone. I just hate it. I wish it could be easier to find someone. Honestly anyone. Im lucky if I get a single match but then dont get any kind of communication from them. Just builds on my already non existent confidence and self esteem.

What Everyday Men Don't Hear Enough,5,2,2025-09-08 01:27:26,"Often, men grow up with the message that they need to be “strong,” “tough,” or “silent.” 

But strength isn’t about carrying everything alone . It’s about allowing yourself to be human.

Things men deserve to hear more often:
• It’s okay to ask for help.
• Your feelings are valid, even if you don’t have the words yet.
• Rest is not a weakness.
• You are more than what you provide.
• Vulnerability is courage, not a flaw.
• You’re allowed to lean on others.
• You matter, just as you are.

For many minority men, these messages can feel even further out of reach because cultural and societal expectations often amplify the pressure to stay silent. 

These are things I tell the men I work with, and sometimes myself. 

Therapy becomes a space where those walls can finally come down.

Making safe boxes for my friends.,1,0,2025-09-08 01:17:46,"My two close friends are really struggling with depression and self harm right now. One (I'll call her Jaiden) recently moved away and the other (I'll call her Luna) dearly misses them. 

They both do self harm and Luna has had assault problems in the past. Now she fears all men and has a panic attack whenever they get too close. 

I'm helping her as much as I can but, I won't be able to be with her always and I'm worried she'll start doing SH once she's alone again. And since Jaiden moved away I won't be able to be there for them most days. 

So, I want to make them safe boxes that could help if they have a panic attack or get the urge to cut. 

I'm low on money myself, so I won't be able to get them that many things.

What should I put in the boxes?"

If she doesn’t sleep, I don’t sleep. How can I sleep comfortably when she’s awake afraid of the bombs?

Before anyone says anything along the lines of “put yourself first” or, “the friendship ain’t worth having at this cost” - know this: I’ve been to very dangerous parts of the world for work, and I am no stranger to her pain. But it also means that I choose to stick with her.

While their hospitality has been incredible, my dad has been making me feel small and useless, by constantly criticising me for a lot of the things I do.

I love them to de@th, but now more than ever I feel like a huge disappointment to them. On top of that, I’m an only child who doesn’t want to have children, which I know is a bit of a letdown for them.

What’s going on.,1,0,2025-09-08 00:38:42,"I don’t really know where to start, because it’s kind of hard to explain. People usually do have some sort of possessiveness. But for me it’s making it hard to hold friendships. This has been going on for about 2-3 years. I cant handle it when friends struggles the same ways I do, have same traits as i have or like similar stuff to me. But it goes deeper. When a friend vent to me I get so drained, especially if it’s something similar to I have. It gets hard to comfort them to because I start feeling so agitated. Now I have started being scared to write to my friend because I’m worried they gonna say they aren’t feeling well and vent. I feel my heart jump if I see they have sent me something, because I’m scared I’m gonna get drained and fell horrible for the rest of the day again. My other issue is that I can’t handle it if a friend likes someone I also laid my eyes on. For example a video game, a fashion style or a skin on a game. When I hear my friend talking about something I like, I will get triggered. I will start talking about it more until the other person doesn’t have the energy to talk about it anymore and I will feel guilt. This other time I saw a friend getting a skin I wanted on a game. The whole day my mood was off during the entire voice chat. Not mention I started whining to myself and I started crying when I saw my friend got the skin, I wanted to rip my hair out. Now i didn’t even want it anymore because it would look like I copied them. That’s not the only issue. If a friend starts liking something and I get interested in it, I get the same feeling. I will try not liking it but I grow even more obsessed with it. Everytime my friend bring it up I will feel miserable, I will be scared to talk to them because I will be scared I’m gonna hear them brining it up. Also let say I find something new I like, my mind will immediately think “what if they also find this and tell that they like it before I do” so i immediately tell my friend I like this thing. It’s my way of saying back away, to claim it. It’s like I need to claim stuff for myself. Because of these problems I have I once dropped a friend because I couldn’t take it anymore I distant myself. Back then i thought they were the problem. But slowly I felt this with other friends too and realized there is something wrong with me. This has made me want to pull away from friends because I’m constantly scared something will be taken away or be taken first, scared they gonna vent to me and I’m gonna get exhausted later. Scared of losing myself slowly. I will probably stopped and try to not befriend anymore people, that way I can have everything for myself and stop feeling this thing. 

I just wanna know if anyone knows what this is and if it’s ever gonna go way. If anyone going through something similar and already found out what it is share if you comfortable. Of course I know even if people have similar problems they can still steam from different things. I’m not sure if I posted this in the right place."
i think I'm going crazy and it might be my fault?,1,0,2025-09-08 00:33:03,"I dont know if this is the right sub-reddit but, I think I might be going crazy?? I'm super confused on my own thoughts and I need someone to tell me I'm not alone/making this up, 



notes for this: I'm a minor, I'm making this as NSFW because it might be disturbing, and I know half this might be my fault. ive tried my best to make this make sense, i might be dyslexic im sorry for any bad grammar



I dont know how to start this, I think I'm going insane like schizo type and i think its all my fault, y'know how people say horror movies/games will make you a murderer? yeah like that.

I watch disturbing videos and i have since i was little, like i was 6 when i found and watched that one messed up show ""happy tree friends"", 

not to be the ""urm!! I watch gore for fun.. if my eyes turn red.. run"" guy, but i have genuinely watched gore before



I'm just rambling but ill try and explain things that i feel and that have happened

1: sometimes i feel blind. my eyes dont blur, i can see and my eye are open, but you know when your little and you close your eyes to practice if you ever go blind it feels like that.

its like walking through a dark room like your bedroom so your mind is on auto-pilot because you've been in it so many times before, its weird 

2: sometimes i have weird dreams, think of the game ""Fran bow"" that type of stuff, and then i wake up to weird pictures flashes in my vision i had one last night.

and when i woke up i saw a photo of human anatomy like something you'd see in a doctors office not gory just weird. and then right after a picture of an eyeball just one. not gory just 1 single eyeball.

3: I have bad fear of nocturnal death (dying in your sleep) I some times will be really tired but i will scare myself to not sleep because I'm scared I wont wake up

4: I hear people calling my name but I never know is real or not, 50/50 its my mom or its just nothing.

I genuinely just feel insane its weird, my therapist think I might have a very small case of DID like very small very minor, my thoughts are weird but I can never put it into words,

I saw something about how repeating the same things over and over and over again can drive you crazy I dont know if its true,

I eat the same comfit food everyday i drink the same thing over and over. i do the same day over and over. 

wake up. use bathroom. get drink. sit at computer. get tired. eat. sleep. repeat.

I stay in bed most days, 

I know I've basically told you smack all about anything but i need to say this to someone because my next therapy appointment is in 2weeks and i know ill forget by then.

I just want someone to tell me I'm not alone, that I'm not imagining everything, that this has happened to someone before.

I know my mom was right ""dont watch that it will mess you up"" I know this is my fault, maybe I'm lying to myself. just please tell me I'm not alone"

Do you ever wish there was someone available 24/7 just to listen?,12,7,2025-09-08 00:28:16,"Sometimes friends aren’t awake or available, but our thoughts won’t wait. What would help you most in those moments?"
I discovered that I'm stupid and this is ruining my life,30,11,2025-09-08 00:28:02,"I'm 21 years old and only now I realized that I clearly have some kind of intellectual disability. This is because I can't carry on conversations, don't think about anything for several moments throughout the day, and I never have an opinion or anything to say. My memory and comprehension are ridiculous; I don't remember what I studied last semester or even details of movies or series I just watched, only superficial points. Amazingly, I joined med school, the most competitive course, at two of the best public universities in my country (Brazil), which may seem contradictory to the story. Before anyone questions this and the fact that I write well for someone who claims to have intellectual disabilities, I'm good at rote tasks, like memorizing test material, like multiplication tables. Furthermore, I spent two years studying at home, so I ended up picking up tricks from previous editions of the tests I took to get into university. Therefore, I don't necessarily understand what I'm studying deeply; I just internalize it briefly, but then I forget because I didn't truly understand it. Last week I went to a neurologist and he diagnosed me with mild cognitive impairment, which could be related to both possible depression (he prescribed me an antidepressant) and genetic factors (which is what I believe). I'll have some medical exams to further investigate the situation, but I don't see much of a way out. I don't even know if I'll be able to finish college, and if I do, I'll certainly be a limited doctor. I constantly think about taking my own life (although I don't have the courage) because I don't see my social, professional, or romantic future. I'm open to advice and feedback."
Why is it sometimes easier to talk to strangers than to friends?,12,18,2025-09-08 00:24:32,Do you ever find it easier to open up to strangers online than to your own friends or family? Why do you think that is?
i literally fucking give up,17,11,2025-09-08 00:21:39,"I'm at school right now, I didn't ask to be here. Why the fuck did I even wake up? There's quite literally no point. I'm so mad at everybody but at the same time, I know it's my fault, all my fault. If i die, then that's the part where people will FINALLY start caring. If I die at school then it will really matter. Sorry if this sounds scrappy, I can't contain all this shit. It's just too much for me. I'm mad at everybody for not caring about me, it sounds selfish but yeah."
"Spiralling a bit , depressed a little, help ?",1,0,2025-09-08 00:12:39,"So I’m a games design and programming student , going in to second year , I came with pretty much no prior work on game dev only until the first few months of my previous education did I truly realise my passion / want for this. 

This summer I didn’t do any internship or even start applying for jobs / placements for third year . Mainly because I looked at requirements , thought about my current knowledge my portfolio and realised I am nowhere near ready

So I spent a lot of time learning and within the last 2 weeks started on a big project putting all of what I’m learning in to it .

Been scrolling  bit and all I’m getting showed is oh yeah I’m going in to second year got Internship this and that or job for my placement 

I have a strong desire to really go through with this , I want this but I feel so behind and that I can’t catch up.

I’m not being scared I know I lack skills and am working on them but I feel I’m not fast enough and by the time I’m ready may not even be able to apply for placement year stuff and may have to change my course the non placement version

For context I don’t scroll that much just recently what I’ve been seeing and reading , yeah 

I know everyone I’m seeing online is not in my course , some do similar things but a lot are different , but still yeah"
feel unworthy,1,0,2025-09-08 00:07:42,"I dont know whats been happening but i feel unworthy of anything. Like the simplest stuff - listening to a song, I feel like im “not allowed” to relate (it sounds even more idiotic now that I've typed it out) . I was never like this. A little bit but never this bad. I feel like I’m not worthy of basic respect and it ruins my life because I cant leave the house because i feel like people are going to treat me like shit. It's what i expect even though it doesnt even happen that often. I also never feel a sense of belonging never did. Even at school, it never felt like “my” place. I moved countries and still feel like this. I feel like a joke of a human being. And i know the easy thing would be to stop thinking of myself so much but it feels like the opposite i don't think of myself as anything.

  
I think a lot of it has to do with my family maybe? They're my life but super judgemental and harsh but also thats most families? I was also bullied as a kid but I never felt like it affected me that much but maybe it has?  But does anyone know what this is??? lol"
Living without sex until 30 has eradicated my mental health and turned me into a psychopath.,0,21,2025-09-08 00:01:27,"When I was a kid, I would retaliate disproportionately to any aggression someone showed toward me. When someone wronged me, I felt that they should be made to regret their decision. Obviously, I often got into trouble because of this, and so I learned to restrain myself when that urge arised. I can still remember how it felt to restrain myself. I remember a crushing feeling in my chest and my arms feeling light.

I have that feeling now on a daily basis. The difference now is that nobody has wronged me. Yet I still feel wronged and like people need to be made to feel regret. It adds to the frustration that I was simply unlucky and not victimized by someone. I FEEL victimized. I feel robbed of a life.

I don't think I have felt empathy of sympathy for someone else in years. I want nothing but suffering for other people. I feel relief when I observe others suffering. If I were guaranteed there would be no consequences for me, there is no limit to what I'd be willing to do to inflict suffering on other people. I only don't do anything because of the consequences I would suffer if I did. Just like when I was a kid.

All of this is because I have been unable to have sex my entire life. When I see or hear someone mention a sexual experience they had, I immediately feel the crushing in my chest and lightness in my arms. It is like it activates my fight or flight response. My mental health is completely eradicated."
Honestly struggling and wishing I could just die,3,2,2025-09-07 23:44:37,"My life is fucked and it's all my fault, I'm 29, struggling at my job, I have chronic pain, I'm deep in debt and I have no college education. I went 2 college 2 and dropped out both times. 

I have ADHD and OCD and I never did anything to make my life better and it's been a downward spiral ever since I had the car accident that's caused my chronic pain.

I could have been something else and been better but I pissed it all away for constant distractions. I know there are people that will be devastated by my death but it's hard not to wish I could just simply blink out of existence. Cry for help because my life is the worst."
Seek testing for bipolar disorder? Or is this just depression?,1,3,2025-09-07 23:37:37,"I have regular explosive rage episodes intermixed with depressive periods. Then sometimes like now things seem extremely clear like I understand everything of what my problems are but I’m not upset. My mood swings and changes.

I’ve been diagnosed with Aspergers if that is any factor."
"I (17f) don't know what to do- (scatterbrained rant, please help if you can)",2,0,2025-09-07 23:36:10,"I've been stuck for a while now. I don't really know how to explain it but the best way I know how is by saying I feel like i'm kind of drowning, in a matter of speaking. For a long time now I've been struggling and I haven't felt like myself, I find myself not really feeling much at all, and when I do its just really horrible and extreme, like uncontrollable sobbing and just overall overwhelmed with everything. I seem to be the only one out of the people I know who is completely panicking about senior year and going away to college. I'm absolutely dreading my birthday (in less than a month now) and I just overall am stressed out all the time and find myself lacking the motivation to do anything but just rot in bed. I try to force myself out of the house as much as possible. When I'm around some of my closest friends, I 'feel' happy and I have fun but I have to try really hard to appear that way and there are a lot of people that probably have no idea what is going on in my head, I barely know, because I feel like i've been masking for so long. My brain makes absolutely no sense to me and I don't know how to handle 'figuring out who i am'. I've always been that therapy friend in my friend groups, and I love being able to  do that and be there for them, but sometimes it can be too much for me. Sure, they ask sometimes how I am and always tell me I can always talk to them about anything, but I don't know how. Whenever I have I tend to get brushed off and I've kind of just stopped trying because I don't even know how to explain what's going on, and if I can't comprehend it myself, how am I supposed to ask for help? I feel like a burden on others and I just overall just don't feel 'okay'. I don't know if this makes any sense but if anybody can help me figure this out I would be extremely grateful, if theres anything that needs clarification please ask, i know that this post is kind of all over the place."
“When was the last time you surprised yourself by smiling during a tough moment?”,1,0,2025-09-07 23:35:47,"I’ve been reflecting on how powerful small shifts in mindset can be. Sometimes, even in the middle of heavy seasons, a random laugh, a kind word, or just a quiet thought can change the weight we carry—even for a moment.

  


I wrote about this in my new eBook The Smile Is Real: Lessons in Light from a Heavy Life, and it made me wonder:

It’s easy to remember the dark stuff, but what about the moments when light actually broke through?

  


What’s one memory you have where you found yourself smiling, laughing, or feeling a little lighter—right when you least expected it?

I have been wearing nothing but long sleeve shirts around my family, my mom has caught me harming myself once before, but I convinced her I did it because I was bored. I want to wear t-shirts again in the summer, but I don't think I can for a while, if ever around them. I have stopped harming my wrists, and forearm, and usually do shoulders now, but the old cuts are still visible on my arms. I'm too scared to tell my mom, because then she will think worse about herself, and think she is a bad mother. When I talked to her about me possibly having OCD, she talked about taking medicine so you don't start harming yourself because of your intrusive thoughts. I sat there knowing I had cut myself a few days before. Please help!"
Coming off antidepressants after 13 years,2,2,2025-09-07 23:23:07,"I need some advice if possible from anyone who may be going through something similar, 

I (28,F) was put on antidepressants when I was 15 years old for clinical anxiety and depression from childhood trauma and abuse, I started on Fluoxetine, then citalopram, sertraline and finally duloxetine, duloxetine worked so well and ive been on it for probably nearly 8-10 years however I've had problems with my prolactin levels being high and then the doctors lowering the dose didn't help my depression so I was due to be put on venflaxine instead.

Since 15 ive been diagnosed with other health problems Anaemia, IBS, Endometriosis and am waiting for diagnosis of chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia and Autism and ADHD, 

Im not sure whether going on a new antidepressant is the right thing to do if im going to be diagnosed with autism, as I dont know whether ive been put on antidepressants to numb my misdiagnosed neurodivergence. 
Im struggling with the withdrawal, ive tapered off over 4 weeks and ive been off completely for a week, the withdrawal is bad, the brain zaps, the dizziness, nausea and bowel issues, the light-headedness, but also the constant low moments where im so emotional and could cry at anything. 

I have no patience and im snapping at people and myself, I have a history of self harm and trying so hard not to hurt myself again. as the last time I did , I cut myself down to the fat layer of my body and it took so long to heal and my boyfriend was so upset he nearly left me and I dont want to risk that again, however the thoughts are so hard to cope with. 

I took myself to a mental health crisis hub today in the UK and the lady was like well the mental health nurse doesnt think you need to be seen by her, so stay here as long as you need. I went there for support and I felt like I wasn't in enough pain to be seen or heard by Professionals. It's been a constant battle over the years with my mental health from Professionals and i find it so hard to love and look after myself and have value in myself, when It takes so long to be heard and helped by doctors when you need them. I feel so deflated, worthless and it brings back all my triggers and trauma.

I dont know whether coming off antidepressants is the right thing to do, part of me wants to know who I am off them, but part of me wonders whether all my health problems may limit me to being on them for life. 

If anyone has been through anything similar and has come off their medication and has any advice or anything just to help me not feel alone In this, thank you."
"If you went to a residential treatment facility, where did you go and was it good?",1,0,2025-09-07 23:22:37,"So basically I've stayed in three residential facilities:

1. A Mission For Michael in Vienna, Virginia - It was okay but equine therapy annoyed the shit out of me. Food was cooked by chef and was fairly good.

2. Discovery in Crownsville, Maryland - Food was crap and staff were cold and uninviting

3. Pasadena Villa near Fredericksburg, Virginia - Staff were lovely, food was good. It was generally a good place to be. I highly recommend this program.

I'm asking because I want to know what kind of places are out there."
How do I support my suicidal boyfriend,2,10,2025-09-07 23:15:28,"i dont know how to start this. we are both 15 and incredibly co dependant and i know its not healthy but i dont have any othr friends and neither does he. we are both homeschooled and spent \*literally\* the entire summer together. now that schools starting and were more often seperated hes having mental health struggles and is refusing to get help. i already talked to their mom but she wasnt a ton of help. weve both een smoking pot since we were like 12 but they dont have any reliable way of getting it ithout me and we live about an hour away from eachother and neither of us have cars. 

tldr; we spent so much time together that hes suicidal without me and pot and i want to help but i dont know how

im really sorry if this is dumb and immature i just want him to be okay and hes refusing help"
I feel down when I have no right to be,1,0,2025-09-07 23:09:44,"Before I start I want to go ahead and say that I don’t want this to come off as a “woe is me” kind of post. I just don’t think I can comfortably go anywhere else with my private thoughts. 

Hi, Im a 20m and for the most part my life has been pretty ok. But there are a few things I want to talk to at least someone about before it becomes a bit much internally. Even if it’s a stranger on Reddit. 

For the last few months and maybe even year I have relegated myself to the fact that the only worth that I have as a person is what I can contribute to others. I am and always have been a chronic people pleaser and will probably continue to be for the rest of my life. I’m also pretty much just a massive hypocrite in the way I express opinions on mental health. 

I would like to have thought that I am someone who relies on fact and logic to determine my next course of action. But recently I’ve found that I’ve been spiralling mentally and am unwilling to do something about it. Whenever I’ve seen or heard other people talk about depressive episodes I’ve always just felt that it was just a matter of self discipline and emotional control, but when it applies to me my whole line of thinking just falls apart.

I wouldn’t say I am depressed by any stretch of imagination, I know I can feel happy especially around my close friends. But I also find that when I am by myself my mental state can just flip like a small switch in my head. From laughing at something I just found funny to a complete shutdown which sometimes includes not eating for a few days. 

I’ve had therapy once. It was to try and help my autism but I hated it. Every time I wanted to try and open up to one of my family I would be met with the same response of “what have you got to be sad about, you’ve never had to go without”. And this is true, my parents are the best people I have ever known and it’s this statement that I can’t get around. I feel wrong for feeling down because logically, I have nothing to feel down about. But my mind just switches in itself with no warning. 

I’m sorry if it feels like I have no point in what I’m writing down but I can’t make sense of it. My life up to this point has been mostly highs and yet I can somehow feel so low. Am I a hypocrite for feeling like this? Is it true that I should just man up and deal with it? I feel like I’m broken when I have no reason to be. It’s not like I can even harm myself because I either pussy out of it or my brain flips back and tells me that what I am trying to do is stupid. 

What is wrong with me? How do I fix myself enough that’s I can live my own life without feeling like it belongs to everyone but me?"
Does anyone else feel like they’re switching between versions of themselves?,4,0,2025-09-07 23:02:55,"Lately, I’ve been noticing something I’ve done for years — I shift between completely different versions of myself. These versions don’t just feel like moods. They act, think, and even remember differently. One moment I’m emotionally numb and detached, seeing people more as roles in my life than individuals. Then I’ll suddenly be deeply emotional, overwhelmed with emotions I didn’t even know I had or where they came from. Other times, I’m overconfident, manipulating narratives (even to myself) just to avoid feeling exposed or weak.

The scariest part? Each version feels like the “real” me in that moment. But once I shift again, I barely recognize the one from before. I’ve started calling them masks, because that’s what they feel like — layers I wear and discard depending on the situation or emotion I’m trying to avoid. But I’m also starting to question whether any of them are real.

I’ve hurt people. I’ve lied. I’ve cheated. I’ve used emotional detachment to justify selfish actions and then used emotional breakdowns to excuse them. Sometimes I’m proud of being numb — I treat it like power. But deep down, I know it’s just me trying to avoid feeling shame or weakness.

I’ve been dissecting myself a lot lately. I’ve even questioned if I might have NPD, but I’m not convinced. I do feel empathy in certain moments — but I also notice how easily I can suppress it when it gets in the way of control.

A core memory I’ve recently uncovered is tied to early childhood — feeling emotionally abandoned when my mom had to leave due to pregnancy complications with my brother. I was only 3, but something about that early experience might’ve triggered this disconnect I still carry. I don’t remember feeling genuine love for anyone since, not even for my mom.

I’m not asking for a diagnosis. I just want to know if anyone else relates to this kind of fragmented identity — of constantly rewriting your own internal narrative depending on what emotional version of yourself is currently in control. Has anyone gone through something like this and found a way to stay grounded?"
Everything just sucks and I'm very alone,1,0,2025-09-07 23:00:33,"I am just sitting at my desk, desperately needing to do some work on my dissertation but completely unable to even to even type a word, and I have no one to reach out to. So I'm just going to put a little vent post here listing everything that I've wanted to say or tell someone this week just to get it off my chest. 

I haven't even spoken more than two sentences to anyone in two days despite my bedroom being right next to all the communal areas in my house because no one even notices when I'm not around. No one invited me to my cousins birthday party today, I didn't even know it was happening and seeing the family photo they took fucking hurts. My friend has not messaged me about anything except herself for five days, hasn't even asked me a single question about myself or had any neutral conversation. I really don't think my friend cares about me, I think she just likes that she can message me at any time and have someone reply to her. My sisters went to see a movie I told them about and was so excited to see without me, they said they forgot to invite me. My dissertation is due in at the end of the month and I'm barely half way but I just can't make myself do it. My cluster headaches are back for the first time in over a year and I genuinly don't know how I'm going to cope with them again. My sisters wouldn't even answer my messages if I bothered to text them, they only really talk to me when they want something. My family are being evicted and I don't want to leave the house we've lived in for 15 years, the unknown gives me heart palpitations whenever I think about it. I over heard my sister telling my mother that she really hopes her daughter doesn't end up with a lisp like me and they both laughed when she said that at least getting her tongue tie removed will help her but there was no saving me. My dysphoria is getting real fucking bad again. My insomnia too. I don't have a life plan and I don't know how I'm supposed to motivate myself to look for things to do after university because honestly I never really thought I'd make it this far. The thing that sucks most about it now though is I thought education was the only thing I was good at, but with how shit my dissertation is going this time I think I've just wasted my time and money to just avoid facing the fact that I had no intentions of living this long. I know I annoy everyone when I talk about the things I am obssessed with but I don't know how to stop. I don't think anyoneevery actually wants to speak to me, it's just an obligation at this point. I am going to end up alone and I don't know how to stop it from happening. I am really afraid of my country turning to far-right politics. I should probably look at getting autism testing, but what's the point when it will take years and only end in stigma? My family already make fun of me for being autistic even without a diagnosis and it sucks that the joke is just me. My mother doesn't treat me the same as my sisters and anytime I mention it I get called dramatic. My sister genuinely calls me a freak to her boyfriend. My family make me hate food. Video games, reading and fibrecrafts bring me no real joy anymore, it is just something to keep me out of my head and I need it desperately but can't do anything without feeling guilty I'm not doing any uni work. Everything just sucks and nothing makes me feel hopeful anymore. 

That's all. I don't feel any better now, but at least I said it all even if it is to the void."
I cant stop crying and feeling anxious,1,1,2025-09-07 22:56:02,It's gotten really bad this last week. I feel like my chest is about to fucking explode from anxiousness and nothing serious is even happening right now. I have no reason to be bawling my eyes out but I feel like I'm at a new low. I just want to be left alone and do nothing all day but I'm too busy to shut out all my responsibilities and it's chipping away at me.
This post is my first time talking about my feelings,2,0,2025-09-07 22:46:41,"For context: I moved in with my grandma since 2014 or 2015 i don't remember actually, anyway she’s been taking care of me since I was just 6 months old, 
and yes, both my parents are alive and I love them deeply, but I chose to live with her because I felt most comfortable by her side

I also couldn’t leave her alone, especially since she’s been sick and needed help, even though she has a maid and my parents + relatives visit and check on her daily, I felt responsible for being there with her

She has cancer and has gone through many treatments, from medications to radiation and multiple surgeries
and during one surgery a mistake was made, leaving her with severe nerve damage and aspiration problems 
since 2018, she had aspiration ep almost every day, sometimes 1–2 times daily

Being the one who takes care of her, watching her suffer, and losing so much sleep myself i often feel helpless, even though I know how to manage her condition
BUT every day I wake up and go to bed with heavy pressure, stress, and negative thoughts

I want to be very clear, I thought of harming myself just thought ive never done that.
 I do struggle with overwhelming emotions and sometimes feel hopeless,

These feelings have affected my health, I forget meals so often that my body doesn’t even signal hunger until I nearly faint
my sleep patterns are the worst, i either sleep for 24 hrs or just 1-3 hrs a night. 
And when someone tries to wake me, I sometimes panic, scream or jump out of bed

this comes from traumatic moments when my grandma struggled to breathe and I was woken up in shock by screams and cries because no one know how to deal with her condition

I just wanted to write my story here just to feel better after talking about it for the first time, 
i was also thinking of seeking help, but i cant afford the psychiatric sessions, so if u have any tips or advice on how to handle these emotions and sleeping issues, i'd be grateful to hear them🙏🏻"

I’m terrified of leading my own life. I’m underdeveloped and sensitive and nobody  can help me. I need to help myself but Idk how to muster up the courage to do that and even if I did, what would I do? How could I try? I said I was going to start to get better in January. All I do is fucking think on a shame loop for months and sleep. Freeze state or executive dysfunction and fear of interacting with others again. I feel incompetent and invisible.

I’m tired of pushing just to get the rug pulled from under me. I spent 3-4 years working remote for a job that sucked after a sexual assault that already made me feel like I’m only good for one thing and then the job after, sure it kept me afloat, but when they fired me, I felt like it was all just a favor to my brother in law who got me the job like I was just a useless pawn and they didn’t want to take care for me anymore. I wish I could take small steps to take care of myself and start moving again but I just can’t. What’s the point? When the life I built up doesn’t even feel like mine. I’ve never realized who I am.

I just want to feel special. I want to feel something other than boredom for most of my day. I want to be the guy that if someone I knew thought about an activity/thing, i'd be the first person they associate with it, but I'll never be that. I'm just painfully average at best, and I'm sick of it.

I woke up with unbridled rage pls help,1,0,2025-09-07 22:18:10,I woke up so angry about a situation that’s pretty much been dealt with. I keep getting put in situations (I know a lot of it is me trusting people aren’t bad people and they turn on me) and I’m always the one that has to stay quiet because if I say something it’s all bets are off and people will come for my throat. I’ve had to hold my tongue on several occasions and I’m sick of it. I handle shit as maturely as I can or I just block and move forward because I just want to be left alone. Idk why I’m so angry about it today but I’m like rip shit and idk what to do. I’m the only one that never gets to say my piece and it’s really fucking unfair. It makes me feel absolutely insane. Advice is welcome!
How do I deal with my dad that’s aggressive,8,24,2025-09-07 22:17:48,"Yesterday my dad had another one of his episodes and threw my makeup down the stairs (since I left my makeup bag in the sink and didn’t move it when he went to shower), threw my headphones, screamed at me that he’s gonna kill me if I do this next time and forced me to clean up all the makeup from the floor that spilled. I don’t really know what to do, I’m homeschooled and I am not allowed to go outside by myself so I have no one else to talk to about this. My mom and sister came back from work and didn’t really do anything about it and now everyone is acting like nothing happened."
Has anyone been over-diagnosed with bipolar or schizoaffective?,1,0,2025-09-07 22:17:00,"I had my daughter in 2018. In 2019, I had a really weird & uncomfortable thought about my daughter. My life has changed every since. It freaked me out and I spiraled. I started believing that I was losing mind, possessed, or that something was medically wrong with me. I was diagnosed with postpartum & I was prescribed Zoloft. I took it for about 3 or 4 days, but I was so afraid of the possible effects.  I began to think the medicine was worsening the panic. I then was suggested by a sufferer of postpartum that I may need to seek help. I went to the hospital & was hospitalized. Because of me telling them that the medicine was making me worse & just being in a panic, I was diagnosed with bipolar. I had to be hospitalized twice that year due to medicine not helping. I was okay for a while. In 2022 i was under a lot of stress and fear the symptoms and they snuck back up on it. I was hospitalized again. They diagnosed me with schizoaffective. Why? I have no clue. I’ve never hallucinated or audibly heard voices. I was put on depakote and seroquel. I was fine and weaned off my medication. Fast forward to this year… After being off my medicine all year. I had a triggering situation in the summer where I witnessed something scary after a heated disagreement with my boyfriend and begin to spiral again. I started to believe that everything was with evil intent and felt so much anxiety. I wouldn’t eat and began to be depressed because of intrusive thoughts. I was hospitalized again where the prescribed me lamictal 25mg and riserdal 2 mg. After a couple of days, I felt normal again. I was ambitious and studying my bible. I felt good. That was june. Now it is september, and I am super depressed. I ‘m unmotivated. I ‘m crying every other day. I just feel down. I keep having the same repetitive intrusive and depressing thoughts. I don’t know if this medication is making me worse or what the case is, but i ‘m overwhelmed and exhausted. I believe that my diagnosis is wrong, and I just want to feel better. My daughter is 7. I just want hope and life to get better. I ‘m only 27. I feel like I had postpartum and caught it late, and now, it’s just been a battle."
Think this makes my last post sound logical,1,0,2025-09-07 22:12:09,"Okay I kinda vented in the last one , and this is something similar I suppose? Ig restating everything and I was wondering if I can get advice
 I’ll copy and paste my message ( Not message just someone I wrote out )

I mostly want advice maybe? Kinda see what this means if it does…!

   “ Probably and def will delete this later
Something I realized I do to people is just , the moment something goes wrong ( Not even wrong ) but something that I find wrong , I automatically have a sinking feeling , and just fucking hate on the person , I just think they’re horrible and hate them for small things ? An example I kinda remember is , during my work there was this training we had to do along side the interns ( Technically I was an intern but my job was the background of it so setting everything up and etc ) and my Supervisor had us do these rooms.
I know I was in the wrong ig ? Aka I was doing an assignment ( Summer school ) on my phone throughout this one room and when a job coach I was kinda liking ? I did like her and found her cool and kinda wanted to know her more she came up to me at the end abruptly when everyone was leaving and basically said I couldn’t be on my phone. Rightfully so of course cause I wasn’t supposed to , but it’s like I automatically hated her , I hated her , I was gonna be cold and distant towards her even though we don’t have a relationship. I just got that sinking people and got so distant and cold in a flip.
I kinda do that a lot , and idk what that even is , or necessarily why I do it , another example. My teacher , I do like her but I’ve always been like a switch ig ? Small inconveniences or even criticism ( Emphasis on criticism ) I automatically shut down and don’t be active , go to her class in the morning , don’t do anything in her class , while also simultaneously wanting her attention so bad and as embarrassing as it is have cried over her before.
Like no matter how small it may be if it’s an inconvenience or criticism or even someone telling me something that I just genuinely don’t like but can’t argue back my personality does a whole 180 towards them. I don’t know WHY. “"
"I won,but I'm not as happy as I thought I would be",1,0,2025-09-07 22:02:29,"A year ago,I did not pass a huge test (I live in Belgium,it's more like a competition to acces to medical school). I was forced to choose a degree,even if my dream has just been teared into pieces. I choose psychology. I was fucking depressed (not sad,like really really depressed). I hated every second of this. I was always sleepy,distracted, feeling shitty... but I did make friends. It started to feel like a routine. I was unhappy, I was feeling sedated. I pass all my exams, a lot of A+. But my dream was Still there. 
My mom (nurse) tried to comfort me on her own way. She also tried to scare me because she didn't want me to be a doctor for my own good, and she did scare me. Not enough for me to stop because at the same time, I started to study for this competition again. I had no hope. In my head, I was going to fail again. I was scared to loose,but I was terrified to win. I started to tell myself: maybe psychology isn't that bad,maybe I was not capable to enjoy it because of my fail. Maybe that's what God want for me.

Guess what, I pass... I think I have the lowest score allowed to pass,but I did pass. 
I'm not happy about it. A year ago,I would have killed someone to acces to medical school,but now..now that's real,not a fantasm...
I'm scared, it's like i'm regretting psychology even if i was unhappy
Why am i feeling this way ?

Anyone else experience depression/anxiety completely DISAPPEARING during pregnancy?,3,1,2025-09-07 22:02:18,"Hi everyone,

I’ve lived with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember — throughout childhood and adulthood. I’ve been on medication for it for about about 18 years.

I’m currently 35 weeks pregnant and, surprisingly, all signs of depression and anxiety have completely disappeared from the very beginning. While I know part of it might be the sense of purpose and excitement about this new chapter, that alone doesn’t explain how drastic the change has been. My husband says it’s like I am a different person. 

I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Do you have any theories about why it happens — like maybe the increase in estrogen or progesterone? And more importantly, are there ways to help keep this going postpartum?

My main concern is that now that I’ve experienced what it’s like to live without depression and anxiety, I’ll crash after the baby is born and return to how things were before. Ironically, this has been my main and only worry throughout my pregnancy. 

Would love to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar. When researching online I find a lot of info about depression and anxiety appearing in pregnancy, but not much about the opposite."
why do i get extremely sad/irritated?,1,0,2025-09-07 21:52:44,"throughout my childhood, i thought this was normal but most of my family members would get upset at this because they thought i was “mental” or acting upset with no reason. 

it doesn’t occur as often anymore, but as a child i would get extreme waves of sadness/irritation. like i would feel so upset to the point i wanted to kms/sh or take my anger out on somebody/something, but i would never know why. i’m not sure how to describe it, but it felt like i would go batshit crazy and start tweaking out and start screaming a bunch so of course that concerned my parents. the worst part of it all though was that i didn’t even know why. like my life would be going okay, even great sometimes and nothing bad happening but i would be stressed tf out for no reason, always feeling extremely paranoid like something bad was gonna happen to me. 

later on, i told my mom about this and she told me how she was upset and always wondered why i would be upset for no reason and start taking my anger out on others. she suspected it might because of multiple reasons like maybe my poor family life/things that happened in childhood or because my dad and his family have a long history of mental disorders like bipolar stuff like that and would be acting crazy/mad for no reason too. it’s not that bad now, but i’m just wondering had anyone else had a similar experience to mine?"
Severe Personality Changes,1,0,2025-09-07 21:41:01,"I am aware that severe personality changes could indicate serious mental or physical issues. Before my mom got her colon cancer diagnosis, I intuited there was something wrong with her due to large personality changes.

Currently, an ex-girlfriend told me she went to therapy and is now on meds because she has a ""chemical imbalance"". I originally felt relieved as I felt for a long time that she desperately needed help. However, I learned this week that she has started cooking and that she has friends. We were together for 3 years and I tried extremely hard to get her to cook more for herself so she can eat healthy. Also, she'd always claimed she had no friends, while having friends. This was the person I knew. Someone who would never ever stop eating fastfood and never felt like she had friends. She's now completely the opposite of who she was. 

Should I be concerned about her? I feel as though I'm talking to a completely different person. If I should be concerned, what can I even do? It's like my Ex has been replaced by a sane space alien."
Week 13 after the last injection of Invega/Xeplion/paliperidone injection,1,0,2025-09-07 21:37:38,"I'll be posting weekly to keep you updated on my progress and recovery for those who are interested. I'm French, I'm translating the text into English, so I apologize for any mistakes.

I had three injections over three months: first 100 mg, then 75 mg, then 25 mg.

Supplements: Sam-e, rhodiola, vitamins and minerals, l-tyrosine, abilify 2 mg, melatonin

Week 13 after the last injection:

At the beginning of the week, during the night, I felt some emotions. They were very mild, but they were still emotions. They were mostly sad. The next day, they had disappeared, and still nothing since. I find that very encouraging, but now I feel like I'm back where I started, which is annoying. I still have zero motivation, but I continue to run 3 km a day; it's good for my body.  Libido level is the same, it hasn't changed, the orgasm is there but still light, it's better than nothing. My sleep is good, I manage to sleep at least 10 hours. I continue to listen to at least 1 hour of music per day to stimulate my brain. I can't wait for my emotions and my motivation to return again. I'll keep you posted next week and courage to those who are going through the same thing as me."

Social Diaries 001,1,0,2025-09-07 21:01:15,"I want to start venting on this app because I guess I have some mental issues that prevent me from venting to friends and close people as I don’t want to worry them.

It’s been this with me ever since I was a little. I don’t vent to any of my family. No one is reliable enough or free or would actually listen without hitting me. 

As for friends, I prefer having only one close person I can vent to but this, throughout my whole life until now, keeps breaking. I get to have that friend for a few years then something happen and I just stop having them in my life as I used to. Then I start doubting everyone around me and decide to just shut on myself and convince myself that I’m better off without people. Cuz I’ll either make them leave or they’ll hurt me.

So here’s to my first time venting. I hope this helps fix my mental health these days as I won’t be feeling like I might be too much on a specific someone by venting to them."
I'm just tired of fighting. I've just reached my breaking point and I'm just left wondering if there's any point to it when all I've known is brief moments of happiness followed by months of misery.,3,2,2025-09-07 20:54:59,"I don't care if the way I go isn't painless and it hurts like hell. I can't even imagine waking up tomorrow and being ready to face the day. I don't see a point in continuing anymore. Every time I've felt happy the other shoe falls and I'm alone. I never get to be happy for more than a few fleeting moments. 

I got dumped and lost my best friend. All in the same day. About every acquaintance I've had has left me. I don't really have anybody I even trust to explain to them what's going on. I feel abandoned. Everybody else is so busy that they can't make the time for me. I think I'm just a burden. 

I can't do it anymore. I don't even know how."
I feel like my mental health ruined my social life,1,1,2025-09-07 20:54:49,"Since I can remember I was always lonely. Never really fit in, always the weird one. Since the age of 12 I was really depressed, always felt left out and unworthy. Around the age of 14 I finally made some friends but not for too long. Because of my anxiety and panic attacks I slowly stopped hanging out, I didn’t have the energy to do anything. Everything was boring and I was just annoyed all the time. I started losing friends, people stopped inviting me, texting me or contacting me. I wasn’t the best person to hang around so i can’t blame them ig. But gosh I’m 21 now and I really don’t have any friends. I feel like my depression ruined everything for me. Even my „closest” friends are not there anymore. But I can’t blame them cause i was also a shitty person. 

I don’t even know why I’m writing this but fuck I needed to vent. Maybe some of you feel the same way as me…"
Going to the psych ward,3,0,2025-09-07 20:53:04,"What the title says. I recently relapsed in sh after being sexually assaulted, my mom found out and now I have to go. I've been there four times already and I'm 17. Im so tired of my life constantly being a loop of getting better and getting worse."
I'm experiencing the worst mental state I've had in a while and I feel hopeless,2,1,2025-09-07 20:50:40,"I'm 19F and I'm diagnosed with clinical depression and ADHD. I was 10 when I was diagnosed. I've been on medication, Prozac and Adderall, for both for a long time. And it really helped. I went through some really hard stuff but I was always able to bounce back from it. However, this year, I started to feel worse again. I've had mental breakdowns over smaller things, and acted insanely irritational. It's been happening more and more frequently since the end of June. I don't know what is going on with me. I take my medicine every day and nothing has changed in it, so what is happening? I've had days where I get in small arguments with my family that will grow into huge fights and involve me being horribly irrational and end with me crying myself to sleep. 

I have a history of SH but haven't actually done it since I was 13. I've had the urge to since, but it's rarely serious. In these circumstances, I'm usually able to self-soothe or reasonably go to my parents for support, but I haven't been able to do so recently. I get really hard to deal with and my parents' patience is limited. They're usually very supportive, don't get me wrong, but they're people, too. I'll go to bed upset and wake up realizing how difficult/irrational I was being. But in the moment, it makes perfect sense to me. In that state, I have impulsive thoughts of grabbing my parents' alcohol just to see if I feel something different. Obviously, I don't drink, but I know that people feel calm sometimes by it so in my head, I'm like ""why not?"" 
It sounds ridiculous and dramatic to say but it's the truth. I've never done it, but the urge gets stronger every time. I'm willing to try anything just to stop feeling this way.

I can't use my usual tricks to calm down. Nothing helps. This year, I've called a crisis line on three separate occasions. Once in May, once in August, and once again yesterday. It is my last resort and I'm so grateful that it exists as an option because it has always helped me. I'm figuring it out with my psychiatrist as far as medication, but what I really need is to start seeing my counselor again. I plan to set up that appointment soon.

This is worst I've felt in a long time and even though I'm seeking help, I'm a college sophomore who really needs to get stuff done. But my depression has killed my motivation. It feels like everything is going wrong and I'm scared because this is the first time in a long time where I don't know what's going on with me. 

I'm just hoping that there's other people on here who have experienced something similar. Just to feel less alone. I have some online assignments due tonight and I feel paralyzed by my depression."
"What is one thing that helped you move on? Really need it rn. Thankyou. (TW: abuse, self harm)",1,4,2025-09-07 20:47:11,"Hi. I hope everyone is doing well. I just want to ask you ladies how you moved one from a traumatic relationship. For context, I (f20) was in a relationship for 1.5 years with a serial cheater and abuser. It’s not something I talk about a lot. But he was most definitely a narcissist. Cheating on each one of his exes, having multiple links at the same time, and more. Our relationship started off on lies and ended with it too. 

He started to get physically abusive mid relationship but I wasn’t able to leave bcz of how strongly he had a grip over me. Idk how to explain it. He once slammed me to the door which led to me getting a hairline fracture and muscle trauma- he took me to the hospital lol. And after cheating on me, he came over to my house because I told his mom, threw a 20L water jug at me, twisted my wrist, tried to snap my neck, and more. 

He still had a grip over me after this, emotionally. I was stupid enough to give him another chance but by staying friends for a while and then deciding what to do. The ‘friendship’ too got super draining. 

A few weeks before today, I had been thinking about leaving him. I kept getting thoughts of telling him that I hate him that I don’t love him anymore that I just want to leave. But I couldn’t. Idk why. I felt like I didn’t have a reason to. I did. But I felt like I didn’t. 

All the conversations we had ended up with me apologising to him. Even if it was his fault. I wanted to leave. So badly. 

The time when we were in no contact, I did the most for myself. But as soon as we started talking, all the will I had to do things for myself just died out of nowhere. I was always anxious. 

Developed gout mid relationship, got tested for auto immune diseases mid relationship, read an article on self silencing women. And realised the issue. Still didn’t leave. 

Im tired. I feel like every time we end things, I say things. Things like I’ve said in this text. And then we get back. And I betray myself. Im a traitor. I don’t respect myself enough to move on. To get away from my abuser. To let him have that grip over me. I hate it. And I hate myself for it. How do I move on? 

I’ve grown up in an abusive family. Broken jars, broken doors, flying bottles, no electricity, bleeding noses. But I ended up staying with the man I was running away from my entire life. I need help. I need someone to tell me it’ll be okay. I don’t want to get stuck in this hole I’m in."

Obliterated,1,1,2025-09-07 20:45:28,"This is a mental health post.

I...want to be obliterated.
I want to become an object, and then be destroyed, utterly.
Not psychologically. 
Not as someone's pet.
Not ego.
But truly, utterly, obliterated.
I don't want heaven, hell, reincarnation.
Just destroyed.
I don't care if there are atoms left,
There's just no meaning,
No long term meaning,
To anything.

You can do whatever you please, and once pleasure is gone, and service, like everything else is an act, a play...

The last thing is to end.
I want to get off stage, and be obliterated.
I won't do it myself, 
I've made promises, for... Some reason,
But.... annihilation...
Someday. And then no more wanting. No more being. No selfishness. No hunger. No fullness. No ups or downs.
Literal nothing.

Is it normal that when my parents  trie to talk to me I feel disgusted or almost as if my day was ruined?,2,3,2025-09-07 20:42:45,"Context, I was beaten and verbally abused every day for 12 years, from the age of 3 to 15. Because of that, I developed insomnia. I can’t really feel emotions anymore, and I have trouble recalling memories that involve feelings. On top of that, I’m dyslexic, so school has always been very hard for me.

Most of the time, I enjoy staying in my room, watching TV shows or doing random side quests in games. When I feel like going outside, I go for long walks in the forest. I avoid eating with others—if someone is at the dinner table, I wait for them to leave before I eat. I’ve never really felt the need for human connection, and I’ve never been attracted to anyone romantically. I don’t worry much about myself. I just live without a clear purpose and rarely stress about schoolwork.

Despite all of this, at school I somehow appear to be 100% happy. I’m pretty popular—probably because my parents are rich—and people often say I’m good-looking, joyful, and great to be around. But deep down, I know I’m not really there. I don’t care about being with those people. My “happiness reflex” is so well developed that I even fool myself sometimes.

The problem is that I feel stuck on that surface level. I can’t feel real remorse for people. For example, one of my school friends lost her grandma—I had a brief fake crush on her because of social pressure—and I didn’t feel anything. I also struggle to feel anger. The only thing I can really show is this fake sense of happiness.

When I’m with my parents, I almost feel disgusted or even angry that they try to socialize with me. (They weren’t the ones who abused me—that was a nanny.) People at school often ask me to hang out at my house or on my family’s yacht. I think most kids my age would take advantage of that, but I always say no and make up an excuse. My house feels like the one place where I can take off the mask and just be myself no cameras and no pressure just myself.

For example, I love collecting coins and DVDs. I once asked people what they thought about coin collectors, and they started making fun of them. That was when I realized I can’t let anyone into my room. At school, I’ve built this image that isn’t really me, people describe me as the dumb rich kid that doesn’t have a care in the world and the is always happy for no apparent reason, I have developed that persona so well that I am able to make jokes that don’t actually make me laugh but others do so I keep making them so that I can look more like an approachable person.—but it’s just a fragment of glass from what should have been a masterpiece of a vase, just one side of a dice, I have developed different personalities depending on the situation, always the happy guy but different styles and hobbies The mask I wear is heavy. When I’m home, I like to take it off. But when my. But when my parents are there, it feels like I’m working an extra shift.

I used to think I might be a sociopath, but I’m not sure. I took a test, and it said 98% probability. But I don’t think that’s the full picture. I’m not aggressive, and I don’t enjoy hurting people. Despite my height and physical appearance, I’m not violent. Sure, I manipulate sometimes—like when I fake-cried in front of the principal so I wouldn’t have to repeat a year—but that doesn’t make me someone capable of murder.

I don’t know. What do you guys think?"

But long story short, i’ve been homeless many times, i was groomed, went through domestic violence and my guardian had an issue with alcohol at one point, i was neglected. my feelings were always pushed aside. This all started when i was 11, it’s many years later now. 

Ever since my trauma started, i have horrific nightmares. All consisting of hurting people or me being hurt, being chased, watching people commit su*cide, hiding away from someone or something, being cheated on… all that. 

TW: graphic. 
One nightmare, i hid in a random persons house and someone with a gun was looking for me, he found me and i got very sharp tweezers and stabbed it into his wrist and killed him. 
Another nightmare, i watched a young young boy jump from his roof and commit su*cide. 
A lot more nightmares, i was being stabbed, or physically hurt. 

I’ve never been stabbed, or seen someone commit. I was diagnosed with CPTSD but there was never any mention about my nightmares. I never usually have panic attacks or flashbacks that affect me badly. My biggest issue is the nightmares. I have them both with going to bed at night and having a nap through out the day. 

Can someone please tell me why i have nightmares ever since my trauma started."
I don't know how to deal with these emotions,1,1,2025-09-07 20:39:24,"I feel like shit, I'm so angry. I've never been an angry person and i don't know how to deal with it, I have so much hate inside and I'm so frustrated that I'm contemplating the idea of sh again after almost two years clean. I know I'm not going to do it, I had to fight so much to get to this point in my life, but I don't know how to deal with these emotions.

Anyway I'm going to keep myself distracted until I feel better."
I think I'll open up to my teacher,4,10,2025-09-07 20:36:04,"So I've been struggling mentally for months with suicidal thoughts, depression and anxiety. I felt super hopeless, but at the same time, I wanted to like escape from this by telling to my teacher everything about it.

Feeling suicidal before a big event. Is it common for depressed?,1,1,2025-09-07 20:34:04,"I'm 22 and about to study abroad. My flight is tomorrow. It's a big change, since I'm leaving my abusive house. Instead of excitement, I was apathetic about it for months. Now when I'm about to make this leap of faith, instead of happiness for a change or a usual apathy I want to end it all. 

It doesn't make sense, but I feel it. Is that even common for depressed people to feel this urge before big events?? How to deal with it? 

BTW I won't indulge in these thoughts. There are people that care about me and I can't do this to them. I've been like that since forever, haven't done any attempts.

Thank you for reading!


Note: I've already lived abroad for a year all by myself before. It was the best time of my life."
Not sure if I can be friends with a guy platonically,1,6,2025-09-07 20:27:23,"It's a shame as I struggle with making friends. I grew this friendship with a guy but I have some feelings. I'm wondering if it is possible to keep just like a pen pal friend and keep it platonic. I know he doesn't want anything committed and he's recently out of a relationship. 
I started to share my inner world with him a bit and then realised he wasn't looking for anything serious. He's always super nice and has been helping me write music. We connect from our shared interest. 
He said he would be happy to keep it platonic and didn't want to lose me...

 At the moment I'm very lonely but I haven't given up on love either. Is it worth keeping this as a pen pal or am I hurting myself? Has anyone ever been through this."
No one can tell me otherwise - first breakup [24],1,3,2025-09-07 20:21:42,"How on earth can I believe the phrase:

""Your life is worth more than this breakup even though its impossible to see it right now""

No. My life is NOT worth more. I always thought I am ugly, I always thought I don't look attractive and objectively I don't.

She was the one that gave me confidence, that blurred my insecurities, and I mistreated her.

My actions have consequences, I know it. but if those consequences are to bring me back to this low self esteem loop, then i'd rather end it all than to try and outgrow that first relationship/heartbreak and find another love, because I know that better than this doesn't exist, or if it exists it's not ""available"" for me.

It sucks so much, I've lost it all, I feel exactly  how David Foster Wallace once wrote: 

""... It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling""


People that tell me ""my life is worth more than that"" and that ""i cant see it right now"" truly haven't been trapped in a burning building that im living with every day.

I cry ENDLESSLY every night. Litres of tears I've cried. Yet nothing changes, nothing has improved in the slightest even if some days feel better than others

Not even in those 3 months post breakup. And we were only 9 months together, but deeply connected.

I feel like I am overreacting but what can I do? This is exactly how I feel, I am not overexaggerating I swear... I just want to be at peace with myself"
"I'm genuinely sick of this, I barely feel human ATP",1,1,2025-09-07 20:21:14,"I'm an autistic person who has developed PTSD and an unconcious coping mechanism: derealization.

Mainly because of growing up most of the time with out my mother (10-14) because of cancer, as well as getting SA'd by my teacher later on.

I've become so desenthesized and disconnected from the world it's fucking crazy. I don't feel real AT ALL. I don't feel what i'm supposed to feel at the moment.

  
Sure I can laugh, feel joy, get excited, but I can't symphathize and rarely get sad.

My mother cried in front of me, and instead of feeling bad or something, I stared blankly.

There have been many other instances where this happened and I just can't be empathetic, I feel like a robot. I relate to the way Dazai described it: ''so much as a human body to which a horse's head has been attached''.

My boyfriend broke up with me today. I simply stared blankly at the texts then got back to my normal life.

Not because i'm toxic, nor because I never had feelings for him.. I simply feel so damn empty.

Now that it's midnight (a few hours after the breakup), i'm hit with this wave of indiscripable gloominess and emptiness.

I even realized how every single relationship that i've had, wether it's my family, friends or partners, has been ruined by my unconsiosness, spontaneity and careless personality tailored merely by this issue.

  
I hate my brain. I wish I was normal like everyone else."
I got fired,1,1,2025-09-07 20:14:08,"I just got a new job working at a salad place. I was really spacey when I worked. Having a lot of OCD which made it really hard to focus. I was messing up orders and caught just spacing out when I needed to be doing things. I often forgot information I needed to retain. Yesterday I called out because I was afraid of working in the kitchen due to the fear of how intense my mind would be with a knife in my hand for 7 and a half hours. 

Ive always had a hard time keeping jobs, usually because of depression. I feel very inadequate. I got fired without warning and I feel so stupid I couldn’t keep a job that most would call easy. 

I don’t know where to even begin applying for disability. I want to work and make my own money I just haven’t been able to for years now. I hate being unemployed. 

I’m so embarrassed and stressed. It takes me a long time to find a job. I have little experience. I have no references. 

I feel pathetic. And on top of that my mental health has been declining. I’ve been having a lot of self harm intrusive thoughts. I’ve been having passive suicidal thoughts. I’m struggling with low motivation. I have nothing that brings me pleasure anymore. And now I have no job again. 

I feel hopeless."
dreams about abuser,2,1,2025-09-07 20:01:05,"(flair might be innacurate since i dont go into detail)

I'm not sure if this is a common occurence for other people, but sometimes i have dreams about an abuser from my past— except the dreams arent necessarily about the trauma.

like they would just be in my dream acting normally, not being violent or very harsh the way i mostly remember them.

just wanted to know if anyone else is like this too lol bc the fact i cant even escape them when i sleep is very distressing to me. 

and i feel a little disgusted with myself, because often times i feel some sort of sympathy? for this person and in my dreams i usually have a good relationship with them."
Is it my period or am I depressed?,1,2,2025-09-07 19:52:42,"Because idk. I’ve been considering therapy for a year, but on second thought it feels like i don’t really need it. One reason (certainly not the only one) would come from a discussion I had with a close friend of mine, in which I confessed to not really feeling empathy towards loads of things (I’ll explain, but please know that I have morals). Another close friend of mine struggles with really bad Bipolar Disorder, and don’t get me wrong I was by her side, but never once in my life, even when she came to me when she was at her absolute bottom, have I ever felt for her. Or someone my age dying because of an abusive bf, or little kids dying in wars. Omg when i was talking to him I felt like a cornball😭 And after confessing allat, the boy went like “hey you may wanna consider therapy bc you’re kinda depressed.” On the other hand I remember how people always told me how emotional I always was, ever since I was a kid. Like, always, I’m self aware. My mom even explained to me the whole hormone thing when I would reaaally feel down for like no reason, and that it is normal to want to be left alone. But those talks (ofc I tried to talk to other people) pissed me off so much. 

The reason I’m even here in the first place is because I had a really bad night and was left alone in thought. Found a meditation video on yt that said “think about positive memories” and I realized that I don’t remember much from the last two years. Sorry if this is all a mess. Have a good night and a good dinner."
Advice on taking control of your/rebuilding life despite chronic/recurring mental illness?,3,1,2025-09-07 19:48:45,"So I (32f) have been dealing with recurring depressions since my teens. I wasn't diagnosed until 2015 after what I can only describe as a mental crash where I had to be committed several times and attempted several times. I was also diagnosed with EUPD (emotionally unstable personality disorder), GAD and panic syndrom in 2015, and later on, ADHD in 2019. I went through DBT treatment for my EUPD 2015-2018 and don't struggle much with those issues anymore, except the relational stuff to a small extent. 

I was not able to work or go to school between October 2014 and September 2020. Since I went back to uni in 2020, I've had to pause my studies for a combined three semesters due to issues with my meds. I have to take mood stabilizers to regulate my  depressions, and developed Lamictal rash in 2022 and had to switch to lithium which turned out not to work very well as I had a depressive episode despite it this past winter, and have switched back to Lamictal (with my doctor's approval!) over the summer (no rash!). I'm happy to be back on Lamictal since I actually improved pretty steadily when I took it before which was absolutely not the case with Lithium (I pretty much got every side effect under the sun, and they are pretty sucky). 

During my backlashes these past few years, I've realized that I'm very afraid of getting worse again, to the extent that I'll ignore the symptoms, hoping they'll go away. That, unfortunately, ends up with everything getting much worse, me having to go back on disability and getting further away from any sort of stable life. I also recently realized that I've pretty much given up on certain aspects of life, like taking care of my physical health (partly due to getting so tired and gaining a lot of weight due to Lithium), having friends, or a love life. 

A lot of it stems from me not wanting to build something up just to lose it if I get sicker again. I guess it's like a coping method to feel so helpless when dealing with a disease that's unpredictable and unstable. Like, it's much easier to say to myself that I choose to not have a partner instead of admitting that I'm scared. 

The thing is, I have no idea how to go about making friends at my age. The people I go to school with are mostly in their early twenties. All of my friends from high school are married with kids, or at least in a totally different place financially and stability-wise. And dating or somehow pursuing a partner? I haven't had sex since 2017, and I haven't had romantic or sexual feelings toward anyone since like 2018. I do feel like it would add something to my life to have friends and a partner. 

I'm kind of scared. I'm not used to putting myself out there in any way whatsoever, at least not in my personal life. I'm scared of rejection, that I'm simply not cut out for this anymore. I'm worried that my low energy levels won't allow me to maintain friendships or relationships. 

  
Does anyone have any experience or advice on how to go about trying to rebuild a social life?"
I need advice on how to handle AS at work that’s getting worse.,1,6,2025-09-07 19:46:28,"(F27) Hi Reddit, I need advice on how to handle something at work that’s getting worse.

I’m a shift lead at a hospital, and part of my job requires me to interact with a contracted worker who delivers laundry to us every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Over the past three months, his behavior toward me has escalated, and it’s only directed at me — he doesn’t act this way toward anyone else in my department.

Some of the things he has done include slapping my ass hard, grabbing my breast, following me into the locker room when I was alone, and trying to grab my head and push it toward his crotch while he was standing on the lift at the back of his truck. He has cornered me in an area where no one could see and tried to touch me. He has asked if we could make out “just really quick, it’ll be fun,” if we could be intimate, and has made repeated sexual comments about my body including asking to see my boobs.

The deliveries happen early in the morning when it’s still dark and the delivery doors aren’t well lit, so it’s hard to avoid him. I don’t mind casual joking or banter (that’s pretty normal in my department), but this is different. He doesn’t touch or talk like this to anyone else — only me.

I’ve spoken to my boss about it multiple times. The first time, she wrote it down but also told me that his son had died a few months prior and that might be why he’s acting this way. She also said that since we sometimes engage in flirty banter as a team, maybe that was part of it — which honestly made me feel like his behavior was being justified or blamed on me. But if that were true, wouldn’t he be acting this way with others? He isn’t. It’s only me.

A week later, I told her about more incidents and asked her to talk to him. A week and a half after that, I followed up and she admitted she still hadn’t. Most recently, this past Friday, he cornered me again and tried to touch me — which confirmed that nothing had been done.

I’ve also spoken with some coworkers about it, so others are aware this is happening. On top of that, I’ve been sexually assaulted in the past, so this is especially triggering and makes me feel unsafe every day I have to see him.

I’m nervous about going to HR because he isn’t employed directly by my company — he works for the contracted laundry service — and I don’t know if HR would even do anything about it. At the same time, I feel like my boss is minimizing the situation and not protecting me. I honestly don't even know what to do anymore, my mental health is at an all time low. I know what I NEED to do but I am afraid of the backlash or that no one will believe me. I'm just so mentally exhausted from this job but I need it. 

Just really need some advice here :(

TL;DR: I’m a shift lead and a contracted laundry worker at my hospital has been sexually harassing me for months — touching me, making sexual comments, and cornering me. My boss has been slow to act and minimized the behavior, and I can’t avoid him because of my duties. He doesn’t do this to anyone else. HR might not help because he’s contracted. I need advice on how to protect myself and make this stop."
I feel disgusting about myself when I like someone….,4,7,2025-09-07 19:44:43,"So I am 23 I used to weigh 55kg when I was 18 then my mental health got really bad and I started eating a lot and stopped leaving my house unless necessary and now I am 96kg and I feel disgusting but I also can’t even start to lose this weight… I am living in a loop. My face is okay but of course more round because of the weight. I have a profile picture of my face on social media and not of my body because I hate it. Sometimes I get dms from men and I avoid it because I can’t imagine them liking the whole me when they have only seen my face. Recently I met someone on social media and I like him a lot he is nice we like the same things but he is super fit and tall, he has tattoos and he is just very handsome.  But then… there is me. At first when I didn’t see him that way I texted back whenever I saw his messages and now I am just avoiding him because I feel disgusting for liking him. He is so out of my league. I don’t think he sees me that way to be honest and I am okay to stay friends it would be a relief even. But I am just wondering if anyone else has felt this way."
Is this ok?,1,0,2025-09-07 19:35:18,"So I don't think I have depression or that I have a reason to be sad/depressed. Life's good, I'm in highschool, I have a few friends and honestly I have nothing to feel bad about. 
Regardless of the things listed above, I don't know what I feel sometimes. Starting off with the fact that I don't miss anyone, never. I could go weeks without seeing my friends and I wouldn't miss them. Second of all, I get so nervous and anxious when I meet people, even if they're my family. Another experience I've had is that I don't think I'm worthy of eating (I don't have an eating disorder and I'm in perfect health conditions), I just feel guilty about simply having dinner. And lastly, I enjoy being sad. I actually seek it. I sometimes feel like I want to be depressed just to have a feeling (I'm a pretty happy person when with people). I like crying and I like making myslef cry withovies and stuff, but then I feel pathetic afterwards..."

And i am so burnt out. I feel like i am actually intellectually disabled. 

Ive felt like after my parents passed...At a young age, i had no sense of direction,urgency, and lost my spark for life...just been ""going with the flow"" or letting life happen like i was just a bystander...

I have been diagnosed with adhd, major depression and general anxiety disorder. But i have been feeling something more is wrong with me.

I know the thing that i am supposed to do, the steps i have to take but i cannot act on it...i keep doing the same mistakes, keep reverting back to the same destructive habits and i cant do anything about it...

I try to break the cycle by just sleeping but i dont want to sleep my life away...

I went on std with my job, and then went on leave without pay...it has been about 8 years since then...

I feel like i have no will, no push, and every time i try my anxiety gets the best of me by making me shake and fear the worst outcome...

I have been off and on so many medications for so many years...and ive felt no different...

Only thing that did help me relax was marijuana until it started to leave me with thoughts of self harm and constant feelings of ""whats the point"" .

does anyone feel or have felt this way?
Any ways around it? 
Meds or advice?

Been trying to find help with getting back to work, new friends that dont judge, and just ways of trying to get over this huge valley of despair..."
How to make daily showers a relaxing and motivating experience?,1,1,2025-09-07 19:33:23,"Taking a shower every day is always a struggle for me. During the shower I usually feel tense, I can’t relax and the whole process of drying afterwards is also annoying, but the hardest is really getting in. My mind sees it as a huge effort, thinking about being hit by water, being an intense sensation, makes it not desirable for my depressed brain.

How can I make showering something enjoyable and motivating? Has anyone managed to do this?"
I have hurt my own father mentally,4,7,2025-09-07 19:30:42,"Because of my father's over-controlling and my traumatised childhood, I told my father that I would never visit his house after I married. I told him this many times whenever he insulted me.

After some time, I noticed he didn't go to the hospital, and now he said I am making my health worse, so I can die on your wedding day, and you will never succeed in your plans. I am your father and will always be ahead of you, I will never let you do what you want. I will get you married to a boy of my choice. I know how serious he is. He also thinks that I will be fine if he can beat me up and I will agree to everything he says, but if a father raises his hand on his daughter, then it is a sin, which is why he wants my husband to raise his hand on me. Because the Husband Has The Right  to hit his slave (wife)

And now I think I should have kept quiet. I wish I had never told him about my plan and my suffering.
Earlier, they just considered me a bad daughter, but now I have really become a bad daughter."

The feeling that your mental health struggles will always be bad,1,3,2025-09-07 19:15:24,"I honestly feel so lost and alone, and I’m scared no matter how much I try I will keep getting proof that I am rubbish at this thing called life. I’m 25F and I have struggled with my mental health since I was 18, first came on after being SAed at 17 then having to care for my mother with pancreatic cancer let’s just say from 18-24 I experienced many traumatic things that caused my mental health to worsen. I have sever major depression and anxiety, and I’ve been medicated for close to a year now, I take sertraline 100mg and I would say it’s definitely helped especially when it came to s*cidal ideation. I am also diagnosed with ADHD. 

This year I cut off 2 of my best friends because I felt our relationship was very unhealthy and felt mistreated by both (very different situations), I also was having intensive therapy for over a year and stopped it because I was going through a very financially difficult time (in a lot of debt) and I felt my therapist was not having empathy for that. But with all these ended relationships I can’t help but feel like it’s me and I can’t make genuine relations, that I’m troubled and my life is worthless. I feel so alone in this life thing. I have other friends but they don’t prioritise me bc they have other best friends or partners. Anyways I’m starting to feel so lost in all of this and I’m wondering when will it ever get better. I feel I actually want to genuinely try with my life and do things but it seems every time I try with life I get further proof that maybe I’m just better not here."

"If Dorothea Dix had Twitter, would she be tweeting Congress about mental-health funding?",2,0,2025-09-07 19:01:54,"Dorothea Dix didn’t back down in the 1800s. She traveled across states, called out the brutal conditions in asylums and jails, and pushed lawmakers to build hospitals so people with mental illness got care instead of being hidden away.

If she were here today, she’d be doing two things:

Calling out overcrowded jails. She’d show the world how people with mental illness are being warehoused, probably blasting it all over social media.

Pushing lawmakers hard. Just like before, she’d demand Congress fund treatment programs, community support, and alternatives to jail.

As Criminal Justice and Mental Health: An Overview for Students explains, stigma and lack of services still shove people into the justice system instead of giving them help (Hector & Khey, 2022). Dix wouldn’t stand for that. She was a fighter then, and she’d be a fighter now loud, relentless, and pushing for real change."
Girl I'm dating manipulates for favors; I'm only in it for her looks,0,6,2025-09-07 18:57:51,"A girl I'm seeing thinks she's so clever, scrounging favors she never pays back and trying to manipulate me into making bad decisions. The truth is, I'm just using her for her body. If her legs, hands, and face weren't so much like my ex's, she wouldn't even be marketable to me.

Okay, let's get real for a second. I've been seeing this girl for a few months now, and she thinks she's the queen of manipulation. Always asking for little favors – borrow some cash here, drive her around there – and never once paying it back. It's like she sees me as her personal ATM with legs. But here's the twist: I'm onto her game, and I'm playing one of my own.

She struts around like she's got me wrapped around her finger, whispering sweet nothings to nudge me into dumb choices. ""Let's blow your savings on this spontaneous trip!"" Yeah, right. As if her ""advice"" isn't just a way to keep me off-balance and dependent on her drama. She thinks she's so clever, pulling strings like a puppet master.

But the joke's on her. The only reason I'm sticking around? Her body. Straight up. She's got these legs that go on forever, hands that are soft and delicate in just the right way, and a face that could launch a thousand ships – or at least remind me of one particular ship that sank my heart years ago.

See, she looks eerily like my ex. The one who got away, or rather, the one I let slip because I was too dumb back then. Same long, toned legs. Same slender hands that fit perfectly in mine. And that face – those blue eyes, that smile.

If it weren't for those features, she'd be nothing to me. Zero appeal. Not marketable in my book. No personality spark, no real connection beyond the physical. She's just a placeholder, a warm body to fill the void until something better comes along. Or until I get bored of the resemblance.

She's using me for favors and ego boosts; I'm using her for... well, you get it. It's a transaction, plain and simple. No love lost, because there was none to begin with."
How to get though each day when you're passively sucidal?,1,1,2025-09-07 18:55:16,"I dont want ""just get through it"" because thats what im doing and its horrible. I dont have motivation not to fail school, do homework, chores, have manners, or even try. Im constantly looking for my next high, something to give me some sense of life away from dissociation and mind numbing boredom. If I had access to weed, I'd be addicted to it. Im just. Tired. And even after all the progress I make to get better the first day, it resets the next, right back to rock bottum. Fuck so times it dosent even take a day, it just takes having 5 seconds to myself. Its so hard to keep a positive mindset when im not doing anything and dont have any encouragements to do so."

How normal is my forgetfulness,1,0,2025-09-07 18:47:27,"So I’m in my first trimester of pregnancy (unsure if that’s relevant) and have pretty bad ocd. I seem to obsess about remembering my every move but it’s not possible for me and I don’t know if that’s normal. 

For example I went out last night had some food and we walked home (5 min walk), I remember leaving , I remember one of my conversations I had with my friend, I remember being approached by someone with a leaflet and I remember getting back to the hotel, hugging my friend goodbye , getting in the lift , getting to my room having a shower and a chat with my partner etc. I just don’t remember my every move like walking over the bridge? Or specifically every single chat? It’s freaked me out. But I know I’m ocd so I’m worried I’m overly obsessing."
I feel like I’m decomposing,1,0,2025-09-07 18:45:02,"Sorry for it being so long and please ignore any spelling mistakes. 
It’s been 3 years since I have felt hopeful for the future, it’s been a blank slate ever since then. I genuinely cannot bring myself to think about a future that i would want for myself. I feel like a machine waiting for a code to work. I started crumbling 5 years ago at 16 and got sledgehammered at 19, life has not been the same since. I function just fine in the society, sometimes i forget the dread not entirely but just a little to survive. But then I remember that i amount to nothing. All that i worked for was for naught. I never even got to apply for any of dream schools, just a local college. I do not see any growth in myself except maybe a little emotionally but otherwise I feel average and I know for a fact that at one point of time i was not average. I had an international medal in sports, various school prizes and a fair amount of extracurricular activities and prizes. I wasn’t truly happy back then either because my father used to emotionally bully me back then too but now all of the things he said seem to be my reality, all because i had no one to support me. No financial support, no emotional support, absolutely nothing. I felt like a beggar, still do. My uncles provide for me mostly and that is utterly humiliating at times because they sometimes taunt my mother who has been the sole provider for my family. My dad is an absolutely mindless and selfish spendthrift who only cares about his whims and wishes. I feel suffocated because of him. And I blame everything on him even though he struggles with bipolarity and severe depression at times but i know for a fact that his incompetence is weaponised. He doesn’t even wish to contribute any longer. He used up my cash rewards from sports promising he will give it back and it was a significant amount. I was only a child. I wanted to apply to oxford or any other top university. Even though the chance was slight, i still figured i had a chance. I could improve my portfolio till school graduation but then covid hit. Dad got full control over my life. He dissuaded me from applying abroad, made me forcefully listen to others and their opinions. Told me about how hard times are and everything. In 11th grade, i gave up. I tried to get back into the mindset i had before but i genuinely can’t. I see nothing for my future anymore. I’m 21 now. I have nothing. My college performance was average. I am currently enrolled in a below average university. My course is the only thing I like however i see no growth here. The students I am surrounded by are least interested in anything but idle chatter and activities. Although they are happy and they’re trying their best but I dont think i fit in there at all, I am unfortunately too white washed to fit in and I try my best to catch up with them but i cannot. I do not what to do. I catch myself locking down upon them at times wishing that i might find someone who might push me to become better but then i realise i am nobody to judge anybody. They might be a 100% better than me. I find myself narcissistic and it’s appalling. I am starting to hate what i am becoming. 





<TL;DR>: used to be a great student with great activities wanted to go to oxford but parents refused because of various reasons, studied in a local college and currently enrolled in a local university which are both below average. Cannot find anyone to help me grow and i hate myself for a bunch of reasons."

I know I need help. I want help and I’m trying to get help. Why is this so fucking hard. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do to help me and my family. Has anyone gone through this process of short term disability in order to have the time needed to get the proper treatment? Has me hiding it for so long going to be held against me as there is no long term record? It’s like everything is happening all at  once and every problem that could happen is popping into my head. Is this hopeless? Will the insurance company just be an insurance company and deny me? I’m scared that I will ruin my family."
How to get rid of old sh scars,1,1,2025-09-07 18:41:26,have scars all over my arms. Some aren't too bad but they are still noticeable because they are pale. They are about 4 years old and I've tried scar gels and haven't seen much improvement. I'm really insecure of them and I need them gone now. I've tried makeup and it never seems to work that well. I just want to feel comfortable in my body. Having people ask about them and having them on my forearms making it so noticeable is really hurting mu mental health. What products could I use? Should I look into laser scar removal? How expensive would that be?. I just need them to be as light as possible
Major Depression/Social Anxiety and Habitual Negative Thinking?,1,2,2025-09-07 18:39:27,"51/male who has struggled with severe depression and social anxiety for decades (since my late teens). 

I just recently got tested for ADHD; the test results indicated that I have Major Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder, with sub-clinical ADHD and some elevated markers for autism (but not enough for a diagnosis). 

My question here revolves around my thoughts: I’m constantly thinking negative thoughts, both random thoughts and also intentional thoughts (and sometimes it’s hard to decipher which thoughts are truly random and which are intentional). But negative thinking bothers me because it makes me feel bad; it’s as if I view my thoughts as an extension or representation of my core self — so the reasoning being that if my thoughts are negative or dark or ugly, then “I” must be those adjectives as well. 

I will say that it’s easier not to identify with or be bothered by those truly random, unintentional thoughts — those are much easier to ignore. However, those ugly thoughts which are intentional (or seemingly so) are much more bothersome and troubling. I can’t help it, however; sometimes I will choose to think something inappropriate or ugly or disgusting for some reason, but generally these thoughts are reactive — they are responses to something in my environment that triggers me to intentionally think a “bad” or “inappropriate” thought about someone or some thing. 

I do understand, however, that thoughts are just thoughts and are not the same as acting on or broadcasting any of them; I also know absolutely that I am a very moral, ethical, and respectful person, so much of what goes on inside my head is not really “me” in the sense of my values or ethics or whom I believe myself to be. 

But the thoughts nevertheless bother me, specifically those intentional thoughts. 

Any tips or insights regarding how to view my thinking patterns and/or how to better understand and manage what goes on inside my head related to my negative thinking habits (specifically centered on the intentional negative thinking)? 

Thank you."

Can this be overcome? Have you ever had patients/clients with similar issues that have been overcome.,1,0,2025-09-07 18:34:36,"28M. I’m struggling to understand whether my mental health issues are something that can realistically be overcome, despite over two years of therapy (TAT). I’m hoping to get some perspective from therapists, psychologists, or others with clinical experience.

Here’s a summary of what I’m dealing with:

Chronic shame: I’ve felt deep, persistent shame for as long as I can remember. It affects almost every aspect of my life, including social interactions, sexual expression, and my sense of self-worth. I often feel that my existence is fundamentally flawed or unworthy.

Chronic loneliness: I have a long-standing pattern of isolation and difficulty forming meaningful connections. I’ve never had a romantic relationship, and social interactions often feel anxiety-provoking or exhausting. There’s a recurring sense of being unlovable or unlikeable, which reinforces my withdrawal.

Childhood trauma and abuse: I experienced significant emotional abuse growing up, particularly from my mother, who was controlling and, at times, dismissive of my needs. This has made it very difficult for me to establish healthy boundaries or a secure sense of self.

Maternal issues and attachment struggles: My relationship with my mother has had a lasting impact on my ability to assume a confident, independent, and masculine role in life. There’s a lot of internal conflict between wanting connection and fearing rejection or disapproval.

Despite therapy, I still feel like progress is... mixed at best. I’m unsure whether these patterns can be fully addressed or whether I’ll always carry these burdens. I’m looking for professional insight into whether long-term recovery or meaningful change is realistic, and what approaches might be most effective given my experiences.

Any help would be greatly appreciated."
"I feel like I can't trust new people anymore because I was lied to by everyone about a friend, and I need advice on how to get past this, or process it",1,0,2025-09-07 18:33:01,"So I'm starting University soon, and my plan was to go with atleast a friend. And that friend I was planning on spending my uni years with is no longer a friend, and I don't plan on having ANY contact with them.

We met during our first year of a college course. Halfway into the year, we spoke more, they told me ""my ex assaulted me, and that's why nobody likes me in my class"" (our group was so big we were split into two classes) and again stated that when they moved to our class. For some reason, my usually suspicious ass didn't think 'hm why does nobody like you if YOU were the victim' but they weasled their way in and made me trust them so quick I don't think I processed it was happening.

We spent about a year and a half being friends. We had arguments, some very recently during the summer break. This has been stuff like breaking boundaries and taking advantage of kindness, taking food and entering spaces without permission - including our personal tents during a festival. 

I realised a few days ago I hadn't heard from them, and thought they were still mad at me for the argument from the charity stand incident. I was gonna message them, but then forgot. And that night, another friend messaged me. Saying that they're a liar, that they were the one to assault their ex. After a back and forth, it turns out the person who told me had known for a while, and had found out from someone else in the class, and that another friend knew WAY before that. Turns out EVERYONE knew they were an awful person, apart from me, and my other close friend (me, my close friend, and this bad person were THAT trio, the ones that weren't usually seen apart in class time, sometimes out). I asked someone I wasn't necessarily friends with but was friendly with if it was true and yeah. 

This person lies about everything. And thinking more and more now, it makes sense. A LOT of stuff didn't add up, or had the same vibe as 'my uncle works for nintendo'. THAT type of person. And I'm surprised I didn't really question it too much considering I had a friend like this very similar, basically the same, in high school. They would constantly traumadump in class, and make everyone uncomfortable, they would purposefully distract me and my close friend during our final group projects (they were in another group from us, and it annoyed their group that they distracted us and didnt do their own work). They would brag about constantly stealing from large supermarkets. They always claim to be the victim. They always have to be the victim. They're entitled to everything.

I told this friend things not a lot of people know. I TRUSTED them. I told them about my memories of assault, but also the fact I cannot tell if they're actually real. And I didn't know someone who did that to someone else was right there, pretending to support me, claiming they related, when all they did was twist the story.

I'm more pissed off that NOBODY told us. THE ENTIRE CLASS, SOME OF THEM FRIENDS, KNEW. And they didn't tell us. I did ask why I never found out, but I've only been given the response of ""we didn't know how to tell you"" So you let me just hang out this guy?? Invite them into my house?? We've had sleepovers, and luckily I don't sleep at sleepovers because I have awful trust issues when sleeping around others. I was the LAST person to find this stuff out.

But now I feel I can't trust anyone all over again. 

I need help. How do I even get past this?"
Aware- My journey with mental health,1,0,2025-09-07 18:32:31,I hope this is okay to share here. We recently lost someone.

What's real,1,4,2025-09-07 18:25:37,I've been obsessed with people not telling me the truth that I've gone on a crusade to make sure that people are honest with me when it comes to a lot of things. Now I see though that this is a fruitless endeavour. I'm fighting against forces much greater than me. So I'm just done with people. I don't know what's real anymore. At this point I don't even care anymore either. Just a long period of isolation will suffice.
Don't know who to open up about mental health worries,2,1,2025-09-07 18:04:38,"Hi everybody, I will give you a short introduction to understand better : It's been a while since I really haven't feel depressed but as the days go on, I slowly feel uninteressed in a lot of things that used to make me live, literally.   
I believe that I am highly influenced by a difficult period that I have been living so far, just happens.

Talking to a therapist makes me feel very unconfortable for some reason, and a bit uneasy. I remember having already procrastinate taking appointments because it was so boring and long to do so lol...  
Have you already felt that ?

I just believe that no one should stay alone and keep their thoughts under their shell which makes it unproductive ; I really don't want to talk about that with my parents because it'll cause more harm than good and I don't know a lot of friends whom I can talk about this..

Who else do you know you can open up to ? Thank you for advice reddit users"
I don't know how to come back from giving up,2,2,2025-09-07 18:00:03,"I only got into a place where recovery is possible after I gave up on ever recovering.

To summarize, I spent a year being lonely during the pandemic, then a year being emotionally and physically abused by someone I viewed as a friend, then a year in and out of the psych ward from the emotional aftermath.

After all that, I moved schools and found myself in an actually good environment for once. I got good friends and I'm enjoying myself, but I still consistently find myself in shambles. I'm having trouble figuring out how to navigate these healthy relationships, I have a big problem with venting and trauma dumping on people, and I still have bad anxiety and depressive episodes that leave me unable to function. I've been relying on my friends way too much and I only recently realized that it's kind of my fault. The only thing that's changed these past few years is just that I'm in an environment that doesn't actively harm me.

By the time I switched schools, I had given up on ever being able to recover. Me and all the people around me had accepted I was a lost cause and just became focused on making sure I didn't make anything worse. The only thing that any of the adults in my life wanted was to just keep me alive and try to make sure I didn't spread my misery too far.

A couple months ago, one of my friends confronted me about my problems with venting and trauma dumping and made some good points about how even though I can obviously point out what all my problems are, I don't even try to do anything to fix them, I just spiral and run to my friends to make myself feel better.

I kind of just spent my summer cut off from everyone and extremely lonely. I now know exactly what is wrong. I gave up on recovery because the environment I was in just actively would harm me more no matter how hard I tried. Right after I gave up, I ended up in a good supportive environment and my brain took that as all the recovery needed. So I just lived with it and ended up hurting everyone around me by relying on them too much.

The problem is, I can't get rid of the little treatment resistant girl in my head who gave up all hope on trying anything to fix my mental state. I can't stop the part of me telling me to just take the cocktail of meds they give me that don't do anything then shut up and go through life day by day.

I don't know how to even start. If I start seeing a therapist again, I don't know if I can trust myself not to do what I've done for a while, withhold information, ignore their advice, then get discharged because they either know they can't get me to accept help, or they legitimately think I'm doing better.

I can't just stay like this and hurt people and get them to leave me or hate me, but I also don't know if I can convince myself that recovery is actually possible now."

And I would really love to hear how you others deal with it, and if anyone has any advice?

I generally live a very high functioning life and a good one too - I do not have any symptoms in my day-to-day life, and no problems with family or friendships, which are alle very stable and good. I have no anger issues or anything, I merely have more than average self-criticism but thats generally it.

Until I start dating, or I put myself in a situation where romantic feelings or intimacy is on the table. Then all my symptoms flare up and I suffer with the tiniest feeling of rejection. I have doe years and years of therapy and self work and education - but still cant stop it.

I dont want to give up on engaging with love and dating. But Without it, I dont have any symptoms - but I also dont feel fulfilled in life, If i can never have a family or someone to share my life with.

Why are people so thoughtless?,12,4,2025-09-07 17:29:05,"I recently started going to therapy. I've struggled with depression my whole life but I’ve never told anyone or opened up about it before. last year was especially difficult worse than ever, so I finally decided to see a psychiatrist. I explained what I’d been going through and they recommended both medication and weekly therapy sessions. Honestly I love it. It feels like something I really needed and it’s been helping me so much.

For the first time I opened up to a friend and told them I was seeing a therapist. Instead of being supportive, the first thing they said was, “going every week sounds like a lot. do you really trust this psychiatrist? they sound greedy and shady. can you even afford that? idk it's weird, it’s too much. even at my worst my psychiatrist called me twice in a month.” then, my friend and their partner started making jokes, saying things like my psychiatrist must have seen how naive and dumb I am and decided to rip me off by scheduling me every week.

I felt like I had to defend both myself and my psychiatrist and eventually I got so frustrated that I yelled at them like ""I want this. I like my psychiatrist. Stop making negative comments about it.” But afterward,as the people-pleaser I am, I just felt guilty for yelling. And worse, their comments made me start second guessing therapy even though I know it’s been good for me.

I don’t understand why they would say things like that. Why couldn’t they just be encouraging? I would never dismiss someone else’s decision to take care of themselves. Their reaction really took the excitement and positivity out of something that was helping me heal."

I worked as a mental health volunteer for an NGO for a year, worked with 7 Cups, Support You, HearMe, and few online mental health platforms as a listener. I have listened and helped people from suicidal thoughts, constant depression, breakups. But I guess there's none for me. I used to go to a therapist 2 years back, after Covid things got worse. I wasn't financially strong enough, and with declining finance, I'm exhausted to find a therapist. I live all alone, with my dog, who passed away a year back. It's all me now, and not a soul, online or offline, to whom I can share my suffering with. I'm paranoid, I have constant amxiety, so much of depression has already trapped me and I don't know how I can even navigate this thing called life. Maybe  I can't. All I want to do is to retire permanently from regular life, maybe survive out in the wilds, maybe face great danger but I'd be at peace. I can't. I gotta earn to pay for my debts. And I'm so exhausted, so tired that I don't have anyone, damn anyone to actually understand what I'm going through and listen. What I loved to do for others, I'm a victim of that myself. I'm not suicidal, but life has been too overwhelming for me. It doesn't comfort me at all to know others are suffering too. I don't want to feel so invisible, so walked on, and so paranoid all the time. I don't want my nights to be sleepless, to avoid myself and try to forget that life is actually beyond our petty worries. I've helped people to be themselves, when in reality I need help more than they do."

im so tired of my own thoughts,1,1,2025-09-07 17:05:38,"I'm doing relatively okay, i don't know why it's so hard for me to be grateful. 

I just had two surgeries this year and both went well. But somehow I can't shake the thought that there's still something wrong with me.

Another one is I feel so stagnant with my job, but it pays well and the benefits are good. I just have so much anxiety now that I might get laid off because the management has changed. But my colleagues are okay, my boss says I'm doing okay. I just can't shake off my anxiety that something might go wrong in the future.

And it's so hard for me to do something that makes me happy and I feel so guilty when I buy something for myself, that I don't deserve it.

I'm just vomitting my thoughts out but these are what has been bothering me recently and I just want to let it out."

I think too much. About life, about future, about small things. It never stop. I try to relax but it’s hard. Even with friends or family, I feel a little alone in my head.

I don’t think I’m “depressed” (maybe? not sure), but something not right."

Guilt doesn't purify,1,0,2025-09-07 16:48:33,"Hey, first time making a post on the sub but.

Recently I've been facing an insurmountable amount of guilt, I made someone uncomfortable in my life that I never wanted to. I was so deep in denial that they had rejected me and I was so deep in delusion that when I tried and ""talk the weight off"" I wasn't really considerate of them, either I over shared, or I shared just enough to begin to learn my lesson, and I believe its the latter. I'm an ignorant fool, I hurt them and they're trust they had for me and I feel stupid, course the guilt doesn't just begin there, it begins farther back in 2023-24 as that's around the year they rejected me and told me they didn't reciprocate the feelings I had. I want to heal, I want to cope, but I dont know if I let my guilt rebuild me or if I fight it.

Y'all probably are a lot older than some random 17 year old like me so you probably share much more wisdom on this type of guilt. I don't know if I'm simultaneously grieving the loss of a relationship I never had with them, or if its just guilt for hurting them and being so delusional.

So please, give me advice, and help me if you can. Much love to those who fight the battles no-one ever sees, much love to those who have survived through the bad, much love to you all ✌️."
I almost cried in Howe Depot over a microwave…,36,36,2025-09-07 16:39:43,"I can’t edit the title…lol…I of course mean Home Depot. I (30’s, f) have always had big reactions when I’m frustrated. But this was a particular brand of weird. We need a new microwave. And when the owners before us redid the kitchen, they made the nook for the microwave pretty small. So we can only get a smaller than usual microwave. We went to Home Depot to pick one out and everything they had was too big. I got frustrated knowing we’d have to get something ugly and we couldn’t just pick out a nice, normal one and I started to spiral. I kept saying “well we have to order one online. We just have to order one online then. So stupid. Why did they HAVE to make such a small space for it?!” My husband, INFINITELY more calm and rational than I, kept sweetly rubbing my back with a slight laugh and reassuring me we’d figure it out. But I was holding back tears. 

What…is this? I do have anxiety, (I suspect lately) depression, social anxiety, and ADHD. What causes such big reactions to such tiny issues?"

I feel so lonely after marriage and don’t know who to talk to,13,5,2025-09-07 16:07:35,"I don’t really have anyone to talk to. No siblings, no close friends, and my parents were never the “friendly” type either. After getting married, this loneliness feels heavier.

My husband is amazing in many ways, but whenever I rant or vent (especially about my in-laws), he shuts me down. He says I’m being unreasonable, which makes me feel guilty for even having feelings. I try to hold everything in, but it eventually bursts out because I feel so bottled up.

I just wish I had someone who would listen without judgment—someone I could be vulnerable with, without being told I’m wrong for feeling this way. Staying far from family as a single child feels isolating.

On top of this, I’m facing job loss right now. I’m physically and mentally drained. I don’t know what to do or how to cope.

Has anyone been through something similar? How do you deal with this kind of loneliness and lack of emotional outlet?"
Seeking understanding,2,0,2025-09-07 16:02:58,"I recently was promoted within my company, we have an employee who hasn't been working out for a few years now. They recently were removed from their position (demoted) but never explained why. 

Her background, she comes across like she doesn't care, yet she says she does. She's slow to respond to messages and comes off sometimes slow in person. There are some common sense behaviors that one would question as well. She's now partly under my supervision where I've been trying to figure out how to work with her. 

This am going through some old paper work I found her prescription for lithium carbonated 450mg. She wrote notes on it and I guess forgot? In finding this it may explain some of her behavior. 

Can anyone shed some light on this for me? I don't know anything about this disorder and I want to approach it correctly and help her improve within the company. Not sure if it matters but we work with kids and need to lead. Enthusiasm is not her strong suit. She's very sweet with them but also not always present. Thank you!"

The thought that I'll never experience friendship or intimacy again is killing me inside and outside,2,0,2025-09-07 15:32:49,"After a challenging week, I'd love nothing more than to have a coffee with a close friend and chat about our week this Sunday morning. I'd love to tell this friend that I am planning a new international trip that I am excited about (and also anxious that my work won't let me take the time off). A few months ago, I went on a road trip through Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, and it was incredible. I'd love to do something similar again. And before we part ways after our coffee chat, we could share a big hug! I like hugs. 

Alas, this person exists only in my imagination. No such person exists in the real world. I am unable to form social connections with other people. 

I am autistic (diagnosed in childhood), which, almost by definition, means I struggle in social situations. There are even studies that show people with autism are almost instantly disliked. 

If that weren't enough, I also suffer from an expressive and receptive language disorder and a speech impairment. Talking is incredibly challenging for me because I struggle with a lot of syllables and sounds. Listening is also difficult because I struggle to distinguish all the sounds and understand the words (Auditory/Language Processing Disorder, baby!). Small talk is a Herculean challenge for me. I can talk and understand speech, but I need people to be incredibly patient with me, which most aren't. 

And if that weren't enough, for more than 20 years, I have struggled with self-harm. Most of my body is heavily scarred and disfigured from self-harm, so much so that I had to change gyms this year because management told me I can't show my scars because it makes other gym-goers uncomfortable. I love being body shamed at a GYM of all places. 

I'm a mid-30s, autistic, speech-disabled man with self-harm scars. I'm basically a walking red flag everywhere I go. If people aren't put off instantly by my stimming and other autistic behaviour, wait until they hear me struggle to talk! And if that's not enough to put them off, let's see how they react to me when I wear a t-shirt and show off all my hypertrophic and keloid scars. 

Unfortunately, there is too much broken and wrong about me for people to see past that. The looks I get, the comments, the ostracism, the social rejection, most people are scared of me or have no idea what to think or how to react to me. This applies equally to random strangers as it does to people who share the same hobbies and interests. The standard neurotypical advice of ""find people with similar interests"" or ""volunteer"" doesn't work. Just because someone else goes to the gym, drives a Jeep, likes to read, or volunteers, it doesn't change how people react to me. This may work for neurotypical people, but not for me. Among the worst social experiences I've ever had have been at the gym, while volunteering, attending Meetups, or with people with similar interests. 

I can't spend the rest of my life alone, without someone to talk to, hang out with, be hugged, or be intimate with. Hobbies and interests aren't enough for me. Other people may find great satisfaction and contentment in their hobbies and interests, but for me, they become dull and uninteresting when I'm always alone. No hobby or interest will replace my desire for a hug or to have someone to talk to. 

This loneliness is killing me."
How do I regulate emotions and feel secure,2,2,2025-09-07 15:28:41,"I’ve never used this app but I need some sort of advice. I’m 17 and I feel like I’m always “splitting"" (for a lack of a better term) and having these moments of pure hate where every hateful thought towards myself and other people infiltrates my mind and I just have to sit there and feel this for an hour and I’ll feel the need to inflict harm on myself. If it happens it usually goes on and off for the whole day and I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle of being triggered by the dumbest stuff. I feel like I’m stuck being absolutely miserable for no real reason most of my days and it’s so exhausting it’s ruining everything. I think the root of it is my deep insecurity. Genuinely is this a common teenage thing that I’ll eventually get over. This has been happening for a couple of years now and I don’t know why because I’ve never had super significant trauma except maybe being bullied and not having amazing parents but still nothing I would consider trauma inducing. I feel like such an awful person, I try to keep it to myself but in romantic relationships it comes out. I’ve never done anything awful to anyone but it definitely affects my romantic relationships a lot. Why might this be happening and how do I fix it? Is this just something that happens to everyone but everyone else is able to manage it?"
Enjoying things only when they have passed?,2,4,2025-09-07 15:26:27,"Hi people, I'm not sure if I should be worried about this so I would like to hear your opinions.

This year I've started noticing I still get excited about things in advance, and appreciate them afterwards but, in the moment, I don't feel anything. For example, I'm a ref in sports competition and I really look forward to events because I love doing it but in the moment I'm just focused on the thing and not really having ""fun"" per se. But the day after I would think ""yesterday was such a cool day"". 

And with refereeing maybe I'm just too focused in the task to not mess up and that's way I don't let emotions florish but it happens with a lot of other things too like concerts, hangouts with friends etc.

To clarify, It's something that's been happening recently, it wasn't always like this but I can't remember exactly when it started

So is this common? Has anyone have some advice? Thanks in advance"

i have a passive personality,a job i don’t particularly like or dislike it’s just there,i have no friend or hobbies,i was never the favorite child in my family(for my father it was my sister,my mother my brother,my grand mother my cousin who excels in an architecture school ect)i was never the one chosen.The only good thing i have is my partner and i know that they deserve way better than me.
Back to now,i know that i made progress:
i talk more about my feelings,i’m going to a speech group,i’m going to therapy and i’m ""thinking""about going to a psychiatrist,starting to take care of my skin,but the void in me is getting deeper and deeper.
Every time i’m smoking a joint,i’m realising that everyone around my age are going to parties,going to uni,moving out and i’m fucking here stuck at my moms because i don’t have enough money to move out,with a job that i don’t like,no friends ect like i said before.

I cannot seem to get out of the depression funk,2,0,2025-09-07 14:56:51,"Recently I feel like I constantly stuck in a rumination cycle but I am heavily dwelling on the past and past mistakes that I genuinely hate myself for. I constantly worry about the way I look to other people, any interaction I replay in my head like I wonder if this person thinks this way about me or if I have upset this person and now they don’t like me etc. I have made mistakes I am not proud of at previous points in life but they are consuming my present life. I can’t move on I don’t even know how to genuinely without it feeling like it’s forced. I don’t even like who I am in myself as a person and then I struggle in my brain as it’s like I am trapped with someone I don’t like. I always worry how others perceive me. I always have but it is definitely worse lately! I just cannot move on, it is really ruining my current life. This weekend I have had my hen do and it was so fun but before it I was struggling with ruminating past mistakes and now I am home I feel so sad and empty and can’t help but dwell on things and wonder and worry what others think of me, all my nearest and dearest people. This is such an exciting time in my life, a big moment, hen do and soon to be wedding and I just want to enjoy it and be present and take it all in and then feel that happy bubble, but if anything I feel a lot worse.
I don’t know what is wrong with me why I am so sensitive and why I dwell so much on past things I regret and hold on to it. I feel overly in tune with my emotions, sometimes it feels like I feel emotions like this ten times more than others. I can’t remember the last time I felt genuinely happy. I am incredibly grateful and had such fun this weekend but I can never fully be present and it’s weighing me down a lot.

Does anyone have any tips, advice, recommended books, podcasts etc to help me work on this because I am finding it very hard lately. Thank you."

"I believe that people with personality disorders like narcissism,ASPD,Sociopathy etc are just naturally very sensitive people",0,3,2025-09-07 14:46:12,"You may think how? these people are as insensitive as they come ,and while that may be true, I think that the reason they are so insensitive is because they were too sensitive. I believe that there are 2 different types of people with a huge amount in between, those who are sensitive and those who are not as sensitive.

The people who are more sensitive feel things more ,wether it's good or bad. While it's good that they feel more and even euphoric when there's positive stimuli  (at least they did at one point), they also feel more bad so it's kind of a double edged sword. If these sensitive people experienced something traumatic in their childhood  (not saying they had a bad childhood as a whole just various traumatic events)  they are at a much greater risk of developing a personality disorder such as say narcissism to cope with their environment. Someone who is less sensitive while not experiencing emotions as intensely are also less likely to develop personality disorders as mentioned in the title.

Though this is just my belief and it could be inaccurate or perhaps just a minor reason as to why these people are the way they are. I do also believe though that these highly sensitive people may also better suited for survival because they adapt more from their environment ,so from an evolutionary standpoint it kinda makes sense. What do you think?"

Academic stress is killing me and idk if I should get help,2,0,2025-09-07 14:08:45,"honestly idk if this is worth posting but im kinda desperate rn. like i dont even know if what im going through counts as ""real"" problems?? everyone around me seems to have relationship drama or family issues when they break down but here i am losing my shit over... school work? feels pathetic typing it out

im doing my masters and holy fuck the workload is insane. profs just blast through material like we're supposed to already know everything and im sitting there completely lost half the time. spend hours trying to prep for one class just to understand wtf theyre talking about, then more hours making notes that probably dont even make sense, then even more time on problem sets that make me want to throw my laptop out the window. spent 7 hours in the library yesterday and still felt like i accomplished nothing

tried all the basic stuff everyone recommends, sleep schedule, morning workouts, whatever. but every single night i end up in this dark headspace where i just... dont want to be here anymore? its not like random thoughts either, its just always there now. like background noise but worse

living with people who do nothing but scroll tiktok and play games all day isnt helping. watching them waste time makes me feel even more trapped because its like... either be like them and give up completely, or keep grinding until my brain melts. no in between apparently

we have some mental health thing at school but idk. is academic stress even a real reason to call? feels dumb compared to actual trauma. would they just tell me everyone feels overwhelmed in grad school and to deal with it?

Its hard to admit but life is getting difficult for me.,4,2,2025-09-07 14:06:23,"Hi there 

I'm a 32 year old cancer survivor. On the surface I probably seem like a laid back guy but inside I am severely depressed.
I have pulmonary fibrosis from the chemo I did that limits my ability to exercise. 
I have prediabetes which limits the amount of foods that I can eat. 
I suffer from erectile disfunction from a venous leak which I've had diagnosed with an ultrasound. 
I am infertile from the chemo and can no longer have children. 

It genuinely feels like my quality of life is significantly subpar. I spend so much effort and time just trying to achieve what lost people might consider 'nornal'. 

Life is feeling quite difficult recently. It feels like an uphill battle and I don't even feel it's worth it anymore. I have no idea what to do. I work a corporate job that I don't particularly love. I have a caring and lovely family though. I have lovely friends too but I can't help but feel jealous of them to be honest. So many have kids and seem to be able to enjoy their youth in a way that I'm not able. 

I also feel lonely. I find dating easy initially but when all these health issues come to light I feel women typically detach and its just not worth even trying to put myself out there at this point. Superficially I'm actually 6'2 and relatively good looking which actually makes things worst because I get the initial interest of women only to see so many of them disappear. I'd rather just get nothing to begin with. 

Overall I feel defeated. I'm not sure why I'm posting this. I know people have it worst. I should be greatful for the things I do have and I do try. But man I'm exhausted. And I don't know."
tips to stop getting lost in your head and the past and finally focus on the present only?,2,5,2025-09-07 13:55:28,"So here I am someone who dreams a lot but above all who gets lost in this flow of thoughts.

It prevents me enormously from moving forward (it literally ate up my summer) and from concentrating. That's also why I scroll a lot (that way my brain is busy).

How can I help my friends?,3,2,2025-09-07 13:25:32,"Some of my friends are very mentally unstable and unwell. I have started to notice their behaviours since I started studying mental health and psychology more. 

The most severe ones are two of my classmates, one moved away just recently. They've been best friends for a long time and really misses each other. 

I'll call the first one, who moved away, Jaiden \[not her real name\] and the other, who stayed, Luna \[not her real name either\].

Jaiden has a really bad home life, I won't get into details but her parents are homophobic and she's trying to transition. She's really introverted and depressed but hides it all with a 'freaky' and humorous behaviour. I've told her not to commit, and that she can talk to me if she needs anything she can talk to me, but she doesn't open up to me. I won't force her to vent but it's still really worrying. From what I can tell she's autistic, has social anxiety, and extremely depressed. Luna told me she's doing fine nowadays but is afraid that Jaiden won't be able to find new friends. 

Luna's home life and childhood isn't the best either.  She vented to me yesterday and told me she hurts herself. She told me she has a box full of blades and a note telling her why she should stop but she just can't. She also told me that her relatives gave her some trauma and she's really scared of men and boys. But she told me she was just overreacting and not to worry. 

I feel like I didn't handle the situation very well. I'm not in the greatest position myself right now but I want to help them before myself. I told Luna that un-consented touching is still considered assault and she was shocked to hear it actually was. I told her no matter what happens I'll be here for her and gave her some advice on dealing with trauma, handling panic attacks and alternatives to hurting herself. She said she was super grateful but I feel like I just tried to solve her problems instead of hearing her out. And Jaiden is also hurting herself but we're not close so I don't know how to approach her about it. I'm an open pan and I'm afraid that they'll see me as a wierdo trying to get close to them every time I act protective."
Why do I get attached so easily when someone shows me care?,11,10,2025-09-07 13:16:21,"I’ve noticed that whenever someone takes care of me, even just for a little while, I get attached really quickly. For example, a guy friend of mine was really caring toward me a couple of weeks ago, but now this week he’s ignoring me and it honestly makes me feel sad.
Why am I like this? Is it normal to get attached so easily, or does it mean something deeper about me?"
Daily stress getting worse,2,0,2025-09-07 13:14:05,"26 m, im married and have a baby 10mo. I used to live my life one day at a time and everything was fine. Now that I have a baby, mortage, 2 vehicles to maintain and a very busy schedule I feel like I'm gonna collapse. The one day at a time doesnt work anymore because stuff piles up way too fast. On top of that I'm trying to remain financially stable but with all these new lifestyle changes things won't stop adding up. How can I cope better with this. The stress is literally making me sick. I don't want to stress all day I want to be able to spend time with my family but the list of stuff that needs to get done never ends"

I can't dream?,2,4,2025-09-07 13:05:07,"I thank u for taking ur time out and reading this. And pls if uk anything help me out.

I am in the 10th grade, I'm 15 and im not a good student. 10th grade is that grade where u parents pressure u a lot, especially in India. The pressure is crazy, but it justified. Now I am a below average student and there are many other kids like me in my grade. But the difference is they are good at something like say sports for an example. I live a pointless life.

See people have dreams, someone wants to be an athlete, or a businessman, or an astronaut. But the problem I have is I don't dream. Actually I can't dream I think. People study, work hard to achieve something. I slack off at school, I barely have any friends I am not good at anything.(I am serious) I just study to pass. That's it. I don't have self respect. Kids at my school make fun of me all the time and I laugh at it too, cause im miserable. Everyone makes fun about everything about me. The way I look, the way I speak, how I am bad at studies. But for some odd reason it does not bother me at all. I wanna be bothered. cause if I am maybe that will help me achieve something.

My parents bug me all the time. My friends laugh at me. It never bothered me. I just wanna know why. I really just wanna live a normal life. Where I can dream and achieve something. Idk anymore the life I live is pointless. the worst part is I don't feel like I need other change but ik I have to. I just can't. I might just leave everything."
Ghostbuster Mental Health,2,0,2025-09-07 13:00:01,"Below are some ways Mental Wellness is like the Ghostbusters fighting the Marshmallow Man.  

Sometimes I get caught up in metaphors so I'd really like some critical feedback on this one.
Specifically the Ghostbusters 1 scene 'chose the form of your destructor' with the Marshmallow Man. 

Here are the mental health parallels:
- People can't NOT do something (like not think of anything) so 'clear your head' is a fallacy.  This relates to Ironic Processes Theory where trying not to think of a polar bear only nakes you think of a polar bears.  Also there is something called a 'dead person rule' where goals must be something you can do rather than to stop doing something.  This also relates to Escape Avoidance in which we try not to think if or do something then the artificial avoidance creates a pattern of numbness or isolation that is itself a problem. 
- Subjective experience is an individual's personal view of their illness (compared to a medical/diagnosis one) so full treatment requires we address the subjectice experience (full treatment requires addressing my bad karma and not just operating on my cancer); adddressing subjectice experience (often through cultural symbolism and ritual) allows for an existential shifts that creates new opportunities for adaptation.  Adaptation (assimilation of not adapting to new information is bad; accommodation is changing your views with new information is good) is a basis for mental wellness.  The Marshmallow Man is a subjectice experience rooted in childhood and photon pack weapons are scifi fantasy representung culturally soecific ritual to symbolically defeat the subjectice experience of problem.  Social construction if clinical reality. This also gets into distress tolerance factors (from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) of having a way to experiment with resilience. 
- Protective Factors are things that make it more likely someone will be resilient and risk factors make it more likely someone will struggle; the Ghostbusters represent protective factors & Marshamallow Man represents the personification of risk factors. 
- Abstraction is how specific or general someone is about things ('me and my wife fight too much' is more specific versus 'no one likes me' being more general); the Marshmallow man represents one big idea of a problem - in Ghostbusters Frozen Empire there are many little Marshmallow Men which might suggest moderate smaller levels or abstraction andbeing a little more concrete (breaking fhe big idea down into smaller parts). 
- Maladaptive coping; people tend to chose things that seem most immediatlely safe but those things can in the end be self destructire - I'd rather drink than deal with trauma so that's a 'good idea' in context of pain management but ends up prolonging pain by creating another problem.  Just like the Narshmallow Man seemed soft, friendly, and safe. 
- Sometimes health comes from conditions of wholeness and accepting rather than fighting undesirable parts of yourself; if you are sad maybe lean into it rather than being sad and also stressed about being sad; etc.  The Marshmallow Man is an externalization of the problem no harmful if it's part of your experiences but destructive outside of yourself. 
- Catastrophe Scale is a gradiant/rules with benchmarks of the worst things that could if have happened to someone; its intended to adjust perspective.' The Marshmallow Man represents a point on the Catastrophe Scale example."
Advice please,2,1,2025-09-07 12:51:32,"Hello. This is my first time writing a post on Reddit so I hope it’s good. But anyway, lately I’ve felt this hopelessness or rather, fearful feeling as if I’ll never get better. I’m really young, so I’m sure it’ll probably get a little better in the future, but I’m really not sure if that’s the case. Soon I’ll have to get a drivers license and it scares me because what if I never learn how to drive? I don’t want to go into adulthood and for most of it I’m still living with my parents.

My nephew (who is older than me) currently stays with me and my parents, along with my brother, sister, niece, little niece is nineteen years old. I don’t want to be like him. He didn’t do the best in school, still he could’ve gotten a job. But all I’ve seen him do is drink and get drunk, vape, go out late at night and come back early in the morning and is just all in all a mess. It scares me because I don’t want to be a failure like him. I know it sounds messed up that I’m talking bad about him on a website with a bunch of strangers but still. No matter what I don’t want to be like him. But it just feels like I might because of school. School has been getting so hard recently I don’t know if I can keep up my high GPA.

In school, I’d say I’m doing very good. I always maintain a 3.5+ because I truly do want to go to college. It’s just scary because I’m in some AP classes, and being a lazy guy, studying just isn’t something I can do easily. But stuff like this requires studying so it really makes me worried than I’m gonna fail my exams and not do good in school anymore. I don’t want that to happen. I don’t want it at all. And then I’ve just been feeling so down. I’m so tired all the time, and there’s nothing fun to do. I barely go outside, not like there’s anything to do anyway. I have a girlfriend, and she’s amazing, I love her a lot. But even then I feel like a bad boyfriend. We go to different schools, and I’m trying to see her every weekend so she won’t get bored of me, but it scares me that I’m
Not enough for her either.

I don’t know what to do. My life seems really bland for me. I know, I’m lucky that I have all these things, but it’s hard to feel lucky when I feel so bad. This’ll probably get little to no attention, but I’m just putting this here since… I don’t know, I just wanted something to write down. It’s almost 6 AM. I need to sleep."
Is this how healing works,2,0,2025-09-07 12:48:28,I'm a student currently in first yr in a programme which I never wanted. So I took 3 yrs drop before this during which I was all messed up. I felt myself burdening useless etc etc. Had constant headache throughout (not exaggerating but it never left...the headache) so yea things like these(if you know how drop yr is)....after getting admission here I just go attend classes and leave. Got no friends. But there is no willingness in me to go talk and...make friends. I do not feel the need for anything. Idc about whatever anyone says or things. I don't get that feeling to study. Tried most of things to get it right (pomodoro and flash cards and some other things I found online) but I just can't. I don't want to prove myself. I don't want to prove anyone wrong about me. I just don't want anything. So am I healing as I currently have no stress....like is this how healing is supposed to be ?
Has anyone experienced this?,2,0,2025-09-07 12:39:10,"Hi, i just want to make it clear I’m not looking for a diagnosis or medical advice - medical professionals are already aware and I am waiting to receive care. 


It started on Friday (2 days ago) very suddenly. I’ve started getting constant intrusive distorted thoughts and blurry visions of someone trying to break out of my mind and control me and feel this constant shaking sensation like shaking of prison bars. I had a breakdown and wanted to hurt everyone that’s made me suffer in my childhood and life and was ready to grab my keys, drive and go and hurt those that abused me. 

This is a terrifying experience as I’m not violent but these symptoms are getting worse day by day, and with each “episode” it gets more and more distressing as a baseline and each ensuing episode gets more distressing. 

I just want to hear if someone else has gone through this and if theres ways of quieting my brain or distracting those thoughts as it’s terrifying and feels so real and I feel like I’m insane. I try to watch tv and talk to my girlfriend but the thoughts just override any attempt."

Being scared of and craving sex at the same time,2,3,2025-09-07 12:29:42,"(M21, not american) Every time that I pleasure myself it's like I'm transported in another body, then, when I finish, I feel guilty as hell and I'm afraid of contaminating everything, even though I clean and wash everything that has to be cleaned and washed.

I feel like I'm never truly clean though, that the sperm is on a part of my body and I'm spreading it in the house, sexually assaulting my parents and my sister in the process (which of course I don't intend to) so I clean and wash obsessively. I also do multiple accounts on gay dating apps and I sexualize myself on the internet, but at the end of it all, I'm not happy.

I'm not happy because I feel dirty, a monster. I feel like I'm doing something heinous, that I dirtied the whole house and that I'm harming somebody. I've also tried to organize meetings with some men, but I'm scared of STDs and intimacy terrifies me. Even now, I feel down, I feel like I have liquid on some part of me and that I'll hurt somebody soon irrationally.

I can't talk about this with anyone, I have barely any friends and my parents absolutely CAN'T know this. I don't know what to do, I hope there will be someone here with my same problem that will tell me what to do."

Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES),2,0,2025-09-07 12:07:27,Have you experienced Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure (PNES) and what was it for you?
Trying to be better,2,2,2025-09-07 12:02:11,"I have been in a relationship for almost a year and it's honestly been not the best. Don't get me wrong we love each other to bits but things always find a way to go wrong

Me, the boy friend is an adhd soul going through a quarter life crisis and a job that's not been the kindest. My partner is an anxious person who had a very rough upbringing that makes her want a lot of love and attention but isn't the best at reciprocating as she struggles with expressing a lot.

Now to add to everything going wrong, when things got rough I cheated with someone from my past that my partner really hates. The cheating however is something I have been struggling with for the longest time and I didn't chose the person to purposely trigger my partners feelings. 

The cheating was planned but it happened when I felt the relationship was done and we ended things. My partner did eventually find out and I begged her to take me back which she did after she tried kissing a guy and couldn't. 

Fast forward to today almost a month after her taking me back, I am pushing myself everyday to be a better boyfriend and cut off my past and be 100% loyal but I don't feel her changing anything.

She's there as a loyal gf but doesn't do anything different or treat me better, she infact is more triggered at even the small things. Our Sexual compatibility was also a big conversation we have always talked about because I am kinky person and she has never shown an interest in doing things different from normal. 

Now I find myself going back to the thoughts of my ex because she was ready to do everything. She haven't once put her feelings over mine because she had seen my love and she knows that that is what she wants. In fact she just wants the companionship and is also someone who prefers an open relationship very much in line with what I want. 

I realise I should goto a therapist as I am typing this and that this comparison isn't healthy but can any of you help me with some perspective other than the one inside my head? 

I am sure I don't want to cheat again but giving all in a relationship where I feel wronged but isn't feels wrong but like I am failing to see her love. But I also feel I am gaslighting myself to stay in this because I feel I have been a horrible person"
Physical Symptoms or Something More? Help Needed with Severe Depression,2,0,2025-09-07 12:00:24,"I (25M) diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety a couple of months ago. Recently, I’ve been feeling a new wave of lethargy and weakness that’s worrying me. Over the past 2-3 weeks, I’ve started experiencing persistent stomach pain, and my blood pressure and heart rate have been elevated for hours at a time, with readings around 140/100 and 125 BPM respectively, which feels like a new baseline for me. Along with this, I’ve been dealing with frequent dizziness, very blurry vision (soemtimes making it difficult to read anything), and my skin feels very hot to the touch.

I stopped therapy a while ago because I was having passive suicidal thoughts, and I was afraid that if I shared those thoughts, the confidentiality might be broken.

Can someone please help me understand if these symptoms could be physical manifestations of depression or anxiety? Or could they indicate something else that I might be missing? I want to make sure I’m not overlooking a serious medical condition.

Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated."
"Two psychiatrists, two plans-Bipolar I diagnosis vs SSRI only",3,4,2025-09-07 11:50:45,"Hi all, looking for guidance on how to think through two very different treatment plans.

Context

Psychiatrist A diagnosed Bipolar I (recent depression and hypomanic episode). Family history: my father has bipolar. Plan: Desval ER (divalproex), Arip MT 5 (aripiprazole), and Qutipin 25 (quetiapine). Follow‑up is scheduled soon. 

Psychiatrist B did not diagnose bipolar even after hearing the family history. He suggested Nexito 10 (escitalopram) only, and mentioned my marijuana use could increase my risk of bipolar given the family history.

Despite the recent stressful episode, it feels possible to move ahead in life. That’s making me wonder whether to start medication now or wait 

My questions

For those with possible Bipolar I and mixed opinions between doctors, what helped you weigh the options-symptom history, family history, response to past meds, side‑effect risks, follow‑up access, or lab monitoring?"
Terrible fear of graphic topics in school,2,0,2025-09-07 11:30:24,"I am in high school and ive started to have this problem about 5 years ago when i joined. As you join high school you will know that more sensetive topics are discussed in class. After alot of these classes and talking about gory violent or graphic things, i start to feel hot and dizzy and aick in class and feel the need to get out. Its always really embarrasing to put my hand up and ask to go to the toilet because people have started to notice a pattern about the times im going. (When anything violent is discusse.) 
The wierd thing is when im outside of school and at home and see gore or read about sensitive things, it almost hardly botheres me. Its almost like the tension of the classroom causes it to happen. Some examples of when this happened was during english class, reading shakespeare and macbeth cuts someone from nave to chops. I thought i was handling the hotness but then i just had to get out i couldnt deal with it.

Its got to the point where i am afraid to go to school because of it. I dont want it to happen because it happens almost all the time and its embarassing and horrible. Its on my mind 24/7 when im not at school because i just know its going to happen again and im worried about it happening all the time.

I really want to get over this because i love school and this is ruining my life, it may sound ridiculous but i cant help it."

Hi. I just wanted to share a message that I saw online since it's really perfect for me and maybe there are people who also can relate.

I'm 25 and I felt like I was behind in life if u compare me with my peers (I know it's not ideal to compare yourself) and I will basically start all over again in my career due to the things that happened to me in the past and I need all the motivation and encouragement that I can get as I navigate this new chapter of my life.

"Is it OCD, psychosis, or what...?",1,16,2025-09-07 11:15:17,"Hello everyone, i dont know if im in the rigth sub but maybe someone in here can help me out or point me in a better direction than the one im currently in.

To keep things simple i've been having what i can only describe as intrusive thougths for about a little under a month (i know its not that long, but they absolutly wrecked me when i began having them and still very much do to this day) so much so that i was scrambling in those first few days trying to find a therapist (psychologist, psychiatrist, just anyone that could ""fix"" me), i could in fact book several appointments and went to 2 psychology consultstions.

Now to give a little backstory to this affliction im going through it started litteraly out of the blue, i was just having a good time hanging out with my SO and i had a thougth about hitting them, this scared the living shit out of me, because i never had done that nor plan on ever doing it, from there things just took on massive awful propostions, different thougths, different images, different statments all going against what i am as a person, what i value most in life, my principles, loved ones, basically everything i am, these thougths/images/statments were the complete opposite of ME, its like i have a demon inside my head telling me i want the opposite of what i want to happen, that i want litteraly the worst things immaginable (and i mean litteraly the worst things you can even imagine) to happen, and im so anguished all the time by this, all day everyday since these started. And tbh this isnt even close to the whole spectrum of what im experiecing.

A little info on how the sessions went:
The first one i was basically explained the OCD cycle, which was something i already had googled prior to the consultstion many times and thougth the symptoms fit me, even though the therpaist never really told me i had OCD per se.

The second one im the one that brougth up OCD and the therapist didnt put it of the table because they said OCD tendencies were present after i had explained my situation, but said it was unlikely i had OCD.

Now im kind of at a lost because as shitty a disease i know OCD is, i was sure i had it and that made me feel kinda better in the sense that i wasnt just this monster who had these thougths just because, they had a reason to be, now i dont know why they are inside my head.

So this brings me to my question/need for some advice. Has anyone ever had gone through something similar and/or can share some input into this? Im really at a lose here and cant see a way out of whatever this is. Can give some more info if needed, just ask.

Thank you to anyone reading this, and any input is greatly appreciated, and im sorry if you are going through anything similar, hope you heal and come out stronger from it."
I think I have morning depression,2,5,2025-09-07 11:03:38,"One week ago, I started waking up with a sense of dread and emptiness. I get angry easily and I feel like nothing can brighten my mood.

I can feel this emptiness in my chest like it's something from there.

Anyone experiencing something similar? What should I do?

Mornings used to be my favourite part of the day like it used to be so calm and serene, just enjoying a good cup of coffee and listening to music, but now it feels like a burden."

We’re really good friends and have had some happy times together, but even though she's not my girlfriend, we’ve dated in the past and decided to just be friends, which we both agreed on. However, we were so close that I felt a personal connection with her. She shares everything openly with me, which I cherish.

Recently, I casually mentioned to her that I’m seeing someone new, and she responded positively, but then I found out that another guy is trying to get close to her. That made me really uncomfortable. I keep asking myself why I'm not her boyfriend or at least someone she can count on. I feel like I'm losing something valuable, yet I can't help but wonder why I didn't act more on my feelings when we were dating. It’s frustrating because I know this situation is making me uneasy."

Weird Intrusive thoughts,3,1,2025-09-07 10:37:01,"Hi! 

Since a couple of months, my anxiety kinda “mutated”. I’ve been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder a year or two ago. i’m 20, with bipolar and ADD. 

Mainly, my anxiety is focused on health issues, more precisely on deadly diseases, intoxication, but also on shocking/ ingest (highly) toxic products. 
i’ve always been very afraid of shocking while swallowing pills, food, or anything without me realizing it or wanting to. (bugs/pieces of glass causing internal damages…). 

But since a few months, i experience more and more intrusive “distance contamination” thoughts. 

for example, a few weeks ago, i was drinking a beer with a friend near a river. we saw a wild rat running 3 meters away from us. i was then unable to drink again, because my brain was telling me it might be contaminated. 

Today, i was getting ready to paint. i was handling white spirit (i do oil paint). i made myself a coffee just before and it was cooling down on my second desk, a meter away from my big work bench. i went to clean my hands, cleaned up a few things here and there and took a sip of coffee to spit it out instantly. i was very afraid the white spirit contaminated my drink and would so put me in danger. i had to rinse my mouth multiple times to avoid panicking.

added to this, im also fighting intrusive thoughts about bees/ bugs and wasps. i’m always afraid to swallow them and be stung in the throat, causing total suffocation. 
it started by avoiding drinking in cans, then look 10 times each angles of a glass to be sure there’s no floating bugs. if there’s one, the drink is instantly contaminated. my hands can be too. Now i’m afraid that when i take a sip a bee/ […] goes inside of my mouth when i half open it. 

i also often fear being poisoned, by family members, friends or strangers. i got to see if the glass is clean and dry, pour the liquid myself. if someone does, i got to check them when they make the drink. i mostly avoid bars. 

i haven’t seen my psychiatrist in 1.5 months. i think i have an appointment next week. i don’t really want to take news meds, i stopped cyamemazin for my anxiety a while ago after 2 years of treatment. 

am i doomed? will it get better? is it just my anxiety? 

it’s really ruining my everyday life.

Does anyone have advice for irrational paranoia and anxiety?,3,2,2025-09-07 10:21:51,"I dont post much on Reddit I just wanted to talk about some of my problems and get advice on this subreddit, sorry if it’s worded wrong but thank you for reading :) 

Im an autistic young person with really bad anxiety. I wouldn’t say crippling, but it made me barely speak until I got home from school last year and look at the ground because I was afraid of people thinking I was staring at them. My anxiety does consume a lot of things I do, but one part of it that confuses me is how I act when I’m alone, being paranoid of hidden cameras. Right now, it’s 4am and I’m hiding under a blanket typing this because I’m paranoid there are hidden cameras is my room watching and judging me. I hide under a blanket a lot due to the feeling of being watched or just “making sure” so that some mysterious entity isn’t watching me. I put a sticker over my phone camera, I explain actions I do out loud so that the fabricared entity knows why i do something, I always kind of mask and act like someone real is watching and judging me. The most annoying part is how I limit myself because I’m afraid of being judged or cringe, like not fully engaging in my special interests even though I really want to because it’s be too cringe. I don’t know why I do this or how to stop, i know there are no cameras and if there are they’re not concerned with me being “cringe” but I act like there are anyways. 

I also have kind of stereotypically paranoid and anxious habits. I look over my shoulder when I’m out walking because I’m afraid of being followed or abducted. Sometimes I avoid doing work while physically at school because I’m afraid of classmates looking at my work and making fun of me for it, for some reason (which ends up with me not doing anything and my grades dropping.) Being distrustful of most friends I make and ending up disliking them for some particular reason, feeling like they hate me, feeling like they will physically harming me, or that it’s just too much effort keeping up a friendship and I should give up.

I don’t think I have a reason for these issues outside of bad anxiety. I haven’t been betrayed for what I know and I don’t really have trauma that would cause trust issues or paranoia.

 Does anyone have any of these issues as well? Do you have any advice? I started homeschooling last week to keep the focus on school rather than freezing from social anxiety, (it kind of sucks having to use a camera though during calls, but it’s working out well so far.) and my mom set me up with a counselor. My mom doesn’t know much about my problems, but she knows I have bad anxiety and wants to help. I’m too afraid to really get into details of my issues with the counsellor, but I hope I’ll be able to soon."
I am overstressed and tired of this life...,10,6,2025-09-07 10:06:47,"Even though it is total anonymous here but because of my fear,anxiety and whatever you call it i am not be able to share it in details but still here is a small summary....

i am losing friends as i entered the collage.... The person whom i was able to talk with for more than 5-6 hours now i am not be able to talk to them for a hour in the whole week..

then again yesterday i again lost one of my female friend because of the society thinking  that if you will talk to a boy he will fall in love with you and then his life will be destroyed if you reject him and she said that her sister asked my female friend to give me less time so i would not get attached... but again the twist that her sister is kind of my sister also as i call her my big sister she alsoo talked to me many times and she knew my personality that i will not get easily attached but still she told my friend that not to talk to me... And this is where i fell the hardest..... Some talks happens in between us last night in which i made her laugh but at last i made fun of her not that harsh but enough that she end call which she did.... But instead of saying sorry to her i said ""it is for the best"" and then slept and now in the morning i saw that she blocked me.

we were friends for 2 years and this small thing destroy this friendship in seconds.

For now i don't have person to share this thoughts so i came here.... This is just a small part of My stress and anxiety as i didn't share the most of the thoughts but this made me break down very hard but again being a boy we have being told to not to cry so even though i tried to cry my tears didnt came out and the whole things is building inside me.

Thank You"
I’m so insecure i feel like I’m stuck in the same place,2,1,2025-09-07 10:05:03,"I (24F) have always had issues with insecurity once i hit puberty, which is generally a normal thing. Now at 24 I’m finding that people around me have overcome insecurity and they’re moving on with their lives while I’m stuck in the most stupid ways. I always thought it was just a physical insecurity but thinking about it, I’m insecure about every part of myself. I’ve always been good in school but i was too afraid to apply to uni straight after hs because what if im not smart enough what if im too dumb. I’m finding myself speaking up less even when im with my friends because what if im not that funny, what if the things i have to say aren’t interesting enough. And worst of all is physical. This has been an ongoing issue as long as i can remember. I’ve always had some weight fluctuation, it’s nothing crazy but that’s always been something constantly playing at the back of my mind. I’m in a long term serious relationship now (not my first one, but the first one where i feel like it will go places) and i cannot seem to be happy with myself. I go to the gym, i keep myself active but i can’t look in the mirror for too long otherwise i feel like im losing my mind, i can’t understand how someone looks this bad. I think i just got dealt a bad card physically, im 5’9 which is tall for a girl and im not skinny i dont have a body thats desired or generally thought of as beautiful, so i can’t even look at pictures of myself with my friends who are all petite i just feel like i look like a monster next to them. I love my friend and the people in my life and im lucky to have these people who show me love and kindness and tell me the way i think about myself isn’t the reality that others see, but i genuinely cannot get over how much i hate myself and how much im insecure.

Ive tried so many self help and self esteem raising things, i just don’t know where to go from here"

Is this an imaginary problem or do I need help?,2,1,2025-09-07 09:47:44,"TW vague mentions of grooming, SA warning flair to be safe. I don’t really post on Reddit much so sorry if it’s worded badly. Im on an alt account hence the default name.

I don’t know how to explain it, but ever since I was a really young kid I would kind of subject myself to problems. I think it’s a lot because I was introduced to a romanticized concept of sh online when I was just 7 or 8. I think it might also be me trying to prove to myself that my problems and feelings are real, serious, and that Im allowed to feel how I do (my stepmom was really bad for me emotionally, she would insult me and belittle me for years and now I have really bad anxiety. I think she is a main reason for a lot of my tendencies.)

When I was younger I had unrestricted internet access and I would put myself in bad situations and “talk to“ people online even though I knew it was wrong. I don’t know why since it made me feel genuinely sick and start shaking. Maybe it’s just a curiosity thing, but I think it was sort of an addiction that lasted for months during lockdown. I still feel compelled to do it now and just consciously seek out bad or manipulative people, sometimes I find myself on the way to do it before I stop. I have no idea why I do this and if I should talk to someone about it. I have never spoken to this with anybody in my life outside of the mentioned creeps, but I don’t feel like it’s really my fault anymore after my friend opened up to me about their past experiences. Im still fairly young so I think there’s still hope, but I don’t think a normal or mentally well person would seek this stuff out and still want to put myself in harms way. Should I talk to someone? What should I do? Im so horrified to say this to anyone — I can never talk about my feelings out loud — so talking about something so controversial and troubling in my head out loud feels like a death sentence.

I also subconsciously want a lot of other things to go wrong in my head for some reason. I don’t know why and I honestly don’t know the details of this, but it’s still related to me wanting to subject myself. Additional information about me, if it helps: I’m still fairly young (and not really comfortable sharing my age but I need help), autistic, have really bad anxiety, and a mostly nice living situation now-a-days (it was really, really bad when I was younger, but I’ve since moved in with my mom.)

Let me know if you have any advice or know what’s going on. I know this isn’t the most pressing issue on this subreddit."
I’m terrified,5,0,2025-09-07 09:41:18,"I’ve suffered from OCD for the past 5 years and this disorder is so draining and exhausting. Ive started to feel like I’m going insane. Im terrified that I don’t actually have OCD, and instead have full control over everything that happens to myself and others. I know it’s illogical but my brain tries to convince me otherwise. Sometimes i genuinely wonder if my OCD is some power or gift that I have been given by some higher being to use to keep everyone safe. It gets so bad that I can’t even think about certain things because I’m afraid the universe or something out there can hear my thoughts and will make something bad happen. I can’t even enjoy being happy, since I’m scared that if I let my guard down, something bad will also happen. And the rare times when I decide not to act on a compulsion or complete it fully, something bad does happen, even if it’s slightly bad. It could happen within that same day or a week later, but it happens. I’m always convinced it’s my fault that it happened. Please help me. I feel like I’m going crazy."
Why do I feel low when nothing is even wrong ?,1,0,2025-09-07 09:18:44,"I'm a guy in my junior year and life just feels stale/lonely sometimes. It's weird, sometimes I'll feel completely fine and 10 mins later I'm feeling very sad. The emotions come and go as they please and I can't make any sense of them. I don't have any problems in life. I'm not very close to my parents but they're normal ? they're chill. My friend group split up this year but we still talk and hangout once in a while. I have exams but I'm not the kind to stress about them too much (I have an exam tomorrow and here I am lmao).

I think my problems root from a feeling of loneliness ? - even thought I have friends. Some mornings I wake up and just let out a grunt because I just don't look forward to my day but why ? Nothing has really changed, I have friends who I talk to. The only thing I can see different between now and last year is feelings I've developed for a girl, which isn't really working out. 

As I'm typing this out, I'm not really sad which is why it feels weird but Ik it's only a matter of time before I go into a depressed state. What's going on ?"
My social armour is weighing me down,4,5,2025-09-07 08:59:04,"So as the title suggests I feel like I am wearing a armour to protect my feelings which is weighing me down. I don't feel like myself. It feels like I am someone else internally but because of this armour I behave like someone else.  
All my life I am living in a disciplined way as other people want me to live but that's not who I am. It was only in hypomania that I felt like my true self and felt alive.

People who have gone through something similar and overcome this, how did you overcome this. I want to break this armour one day at a time, please help me!"
Am I Struggling With Dissociation?,1,0,2025-09-07 08:44:25,"Hello, I’ve had “people” for as long as i remember 
i had always daydreamed really young as a child and i have had “identities” since 13 but i am aware i had people before hand. I have had what appeared to be non physical seizures in the past at a peaceful time in my life that involved me having Deja vu and getting confused in the bathroom and I have also had moments where I saw around me a black and white crunchy filter as well as for years, experiencing bruising that I did not remember all over my legs and suspiciously now leaving when my identities or characters or people have gone. When I discovered something may be wrong, I stopped changing into these characters or identities but still continue to daydream. I also experienced grief which is something I never feel like I fully experienced even when people around me passed away from my family. I Believe these people are my gods and I put them over anyone else and have felt intense rage when people have told me they are not real to the point I would turn against them. They have different names, ages and genders but sometimes I have had difficulty understanding if they are a part of me or me and if I’m making it up and I have also had problems where a part of me believes they are external people and I have searched for them online and thought they would come to me in physical form even though I try to believe they are a part of me. When I daydream when I become what appears are someone else, I change into them appearance wise and even go to the extremes of changing my name and believing that my family is false and that they are my family. I talk to them and interact with them in the physical space but like, I don’t see see them. It’s like it’s visual but I believe that they have been there or are there. I’ve gone and tried to receive help for this however, I have been told I have traits for ADHD and it seems the symptoms I have that seem to be physical but keep coming up as normal are being neglected by professionals. I also seem to struggle with memory and can not really bring up memories unless someone brings them up and I can not remember all of my birthdays except my recent ones and I have moments where someone will talk and I will completely forget what they have said and the list goes on. I don’t know what I am dealing with and it has got worse to the point I’m pushing people Away. I feel like they are not as individual and it’s me but I’m not seeing it that way and instead I’m seeing them as completely separate people and sometimes I believe I’ll come across them in this lifetime. I Also struggle with paranoia and constantly have to check my wardrobe if it’s open or when I leave the bathroom, I have to check the wardrobe because I believe someone has come in my room and gone in or when I’m in the bathroom, I feel uncomfortable because I feel like there are cameras. I have a great level of awareness and do try to find out what is going on but it seems my awareness to reality is fading over time. I Also can not watch weird videos online that like talk to me that relevant to my identities or people because I will believe it’s them that are talking to me from the screen and I can not watch back room videos or like ambience videos because I get addicted and start going a bit too deep into them. I was just wondering if anyone knows what I may be dealing with 
Thank you 
I appreciate it"
"how do you handle the unexpected at work? Do you lean into it, or does it throw you off balance?",1,0,2025-09-07 08:43:33,"Lately I’ve been realising that my biggest challenges at work aren’t the technical tasks — it’s the *unexpected stuff*. A project collapsing overnight, a sudden change of direction, or that email that lands just as I’m about to switch off.

What I’ve noticed is that my ability to adapt seems to matter more than my ability to plan. I recently learned there’s actually a name for this: **psychological flexibility**.

Basically, it’s about staying present, adjusting when things shift, and still acting in line with what really matters. I’ve started practising small things like:

* asking myself *“What matters most here?”* before reacting under stress
* noticing thoughts like *“I can’t handle this”* and reframing them as *“I’m having the thought that I can’t handle this”* — weirdly, that little shift helps me not get stuck.

It’s not easy, but I’ve found the more I practise, the quicker I bounce back from setbacks.

I’m curious though — how do *you* handle the unexpected at work? Do you lean into it, or does it throw you off balance?"
I'm afraid my dad is depressed.,0,3,2025-09-07 08:36:31,So hi I'm m20 and my mom brought to my attention that my dad has been depressed. He only goes out on walks is with my cat works or watches TV till he falls asleep. I have never seen my dad like this before. He used to take anxiety medicine but he stopped because he doesn't believe in medicine. He does go to a therapist but me and my mom feel like there not making any progress because they share a lot of the same beliefs. (Including not taking medicine or going to doctor's). I wanna text my dad and ask him if he's okay. Just my dad was raised in a men can't cry men don't need therapy toxic household. So he doesn't tell us much stuff because he's embarrassed. I'm worried about my dad because I love him a lot. I don't know what I can do to help him. Anything I could do?? I need advice
How do I distinguish between mental illness and discontinuation syndrome?,1,1,2025-09-07 08:35:26,"I have been taking sertraline for OCD for 10 years and have been on 200mg for a while. In March unaware of the consequences, I abruptly discontinued and was manic either directly after or I could have been before, even though I only felt to be manic after. I was then hospitalised days later and drugged up on everything but sertraline, and then a month later became depressed and have seen no improvement since. The psychiatrists said during my admission that cessation of sertraline did not cause me to behave the way I did (even though there are cases that suggests the contrary) and psychiatrists seen after suggest that the depression can't be withdrawal and is bipolar.

Now putting everything else out of the way, if these symptoms can all be attributed to bipolar that means that I suffered NO withdrawal symptoms from cold turkey'ing the max dose of sertraline that I have been on for 10 YEARS. I just can't wrap my head around it.

This state is so debilitating and I can't even prove whether or not this would have happened if I just went back on sertraline a couple days after becoming manic (of course I did not because at the time it felt like an improvement). Perhaps my mania would have subsided.

There are no tests or scans that can prove ANYTHING and everything is deduced from symptoms."

Worried and struggling with mental health and need support,1,0,2025-09-07 08:30:03,"I'm a 19-year-old female, and I’ve been really struggling with my mental health lately. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and it has been extremely difficult, stressful, and exhausting—not just for me, but for those around me as well.

I’ve been feeling very depressed recently, which makes it hard for me to fall asleep. Yet, when I need to wake up, I can't bring myself to get out of bed. This leads to oversleeping, and I’m not enjoying life at all anymore, except for small moments with my boyfriend where I find some peace and happiness.

My anxiety has become so overwhelming that I can’t go to the store anymore, especially during the daytime. When I absolutely have to go, I wait until just before it closes to avoid large crowds. Even the smallest situations can trigger an anxiety attack—like having trouble finding something, too many people walking by, or feeling like someone is too close to me.

My ADHD is also challenging right now; I can't seem to focus on anything, and my impulses have been really bad and I can’t seem to control my emotions. I get angry very easily, and then I get mad at myself for getting angry about something minor. This cycle leads to me crying and feeling deep sadness, all because I reacted poorly to something trivial.

This situation is really scaring me because I don’t understand why I’ve been feeling this way lately. My boyfriend understandably finds it hard to grasp what I’m going through, especially since I struggle to communicate it properly. I’m about to see a therapist, but my appointment isn’t for a while. I really need help understanding what might be going on with me and finding healthier ways to cope, as well as figuring out how to communicate my feelings to my boyfriend."
I Feel like my life has no purpose,8,6,2025-09-07 08:27:19,"20-M. Long story short as the title says i feel like i got no purpose in my damn life. For start i never really had a childhood. Until 18 when i got to uni i had no friends - like no jokes until i finished high school i was just walking alone at school breaks. I also had no interests/hobbies and i didn't care about anything in my life, the only thing i did was go to school as a chore and then come home and play videogames or watch youtube videos all day and nothing else. I had birthday parties only with relatives and no kids in my age and seing others doing so made me go mad. I also had no crushes or any normal social relationships really. As long as i can remember i always had anxiety and thoughts like i am useless.

How can I tell if my meds are working?,2,0,2025-09-07 08:03:41,"Hi guys,   
(disc: English is not my first language so pls excuse any errors <3 ).

I started taking meds for my mental health about two months ago (Sertraline specifically),   
and I wondered how am I supposed to ""feel"" its effects?

Like, I generally feel better: I have more energy, less intrusive thoughts and flashbacks and also less executive dysfunction episodes.  
On the other hand, a lot changed for me in these past two months which effected positively on my general mood, and the 'extra energy' feels a lot of the time like 'anxiety on steroids', so it's difficult to differentiate between the pills and the other stuff that happened, which brings me to ask:

How did you feel the effects of the pills you're taking?  
were you actually able to feel if something specific had changed or was it more general, barely noticeable, improvement of your mood? 

For those of you who switched between meds: What made you come to that decision? How did you know it didn't actually work?

I guess what I'm trying to ask is: How can I be sure this is not a placebo effect or simply the peak of my mood cycle, but actually the meds?

Thanks :)"
having a really tough time letting go of my family to live my future,1,0,2025-09-07 07:55:41,"I’m 24F for context and I still live with my parents, since i’m a student, I will finish my masters on january 2027. I’m very attached mostly to my mom, we never spend a lot of time apart, she’s kind of my best friend. 

I know i’m nearing an age where i have to leave my parents house and be by myself, especially since i’m looking for a phd overseas. It would be a huge opportunity for myself and my career. But i’m scared of self sabotage because i’m so so so terrified of leaving my home. 

Like how do you let go? If i do go study abroad, i’m not sure i will be able to visit for the entire time i will be there (4 years), i just know i wont be able to visit for at least one year. This is making me have so much emotional pain. So much stuff can happen during that time, my parents are already old, what if something happens? I also have two cats, i can’t put them through a 24h long flight so they have to they here, will they be okay? will my parents be able to take care of them properly with age coming? will I be okay without my babies? 

I’m so excited about this opportunity and I’m working and studying so hard to make it possible for me. But at the same time i’m so sad and so terrified by the thought of it. I hate this. I’m very attached to people and have a very hard time letting go. I don’t know what to do, i don’t want to miss out on this, i think having the opportunity i will go, but i don’t want to become depressed and cry everyday and regret my decision once i get to my destination. 

HELP. How do i change this mindset."
Procrastination is killing me,2,1,2025-09-07 07:24:46,"My habit of procrastinating is killing my future, and I’m the only one responsible.

I’m 25, studying to get a very prestigious job (a job I’ve always dreamed of) that requires passing a very tough exam with only a few spots available.



The workload is huge, but despite that, I spend my days wasting time.

I sit at my desk, start studying, and after about an hour my mind drifts away. Suddenly it’s evening, and I’ve wasted another day playing video games or doing literally ANYTHING other than studying (yesterday I even preferred fixing a wardrobe instead of studying).

Unfortunately, I’ve never had a strong sense of duty.

When I was a kid, my parents were very strict with me. For example, they only allowed me to play video games for half an hour a week, in the evening, and only if I had behaved well and finished all my homework.

Of course, that little time was never enough, and as soon as I started staying home alone, instead of doing what I was supposed to do, I spent my days playing video games to “make up” for the time I wasn’t allowed.

The problem is that this bad habit stayed with me. Now, whenever I’m alone, my brain FORCES me to stop what I’m doing and go play video games.

The ironic thing is that when I actually have free time to play, I’d rather do something else (go to the gym, go out with my girlfriend). So I don’t even know if the problem is really about video games or if it’s more like some unresolved “need to rebel.”

This issue is destroying me, because everyone around me is supporting me in this career project.

My parents support me financially, my girlfriend tells me she believes in me and is sure I’ll get the job, and my friends say the same.

But I feel like an impostor and a complete failure who knows he won’t go anywhere, because I don’t have any real sense of duty and would rather throw away my future.

Sometimes I just want to sit in a corner, cry, and tell everyone that they’re cheering for someone useless.

If anyone has any advice, I’d really appreciate it."
Okay so I think I might be autistic in a way not sure but seems accurate in some ways,2,1,2025-09-07 06:49:57,"So I have done a test that told me I am %97 autistic/neurodiverse. I am goint to talk to my therapist about it but I wanted to get some opinions. I always thought I think different than other people. And I fear people wouldnt understand me because back when I was a kis they usually didnt and that caused for me to close in myself not share anything, be ashamed of myself. Also I understand people very well and analyze them observing their behaviour and patterns shortly, what traumas they got growing up etc. I used to have a persona created by myself to engage conversations and communicate but once I realised it was fake and I was not acting how I feel I was playing a character during therapy I let go of that persona. I grew up abused by narcissistic father and got lots of traumas. So I always thought I dont trust people to open up about myself is about this and probably is but with that I think there is no way for people to actually understand me. I see different things, details in things. New ideas, scripts pop into my head by random moments (I am a writer). When I was a kid till highschool I said things that got me in trouble with people and never understood why they did. I mean I have traumas certainly but I think it has something to do with autism also. This idea gives me a relief because I have been ashamed of myself my thoughts or my ideas but again I know a test on the internet is not 100% accurate. I always tried to be social without my persona and never accomplish. I cant talk to people freely because I am almost certain they wont understand me even the people Im closest and comfortable to be around. What do you think?"
